        <p><a href="pr4adventure.zip">starter code for the adventure option</a></p>
<p>In this project you will be making your own text-based adventure game.  In such a game, a player walks around in some sort of world, exploring or accomplishing a task. You can pick the game’s theme (what sort of world it is, etc.), what sort of activities are most important (fight monsters? trade resources?), and what the goal is.</p>
<p>We have provided the code with a very simple game to start with. It has a very small world and is a lackluster game, to say the least, but the code provides a framework from which to build your program. There are several Python files that make up the program, each defining classes that help make up the contents of the world. You should start by playing its game (you’ll want to run the script <code>main.py</code>) and then look through the code to see how the code works. (When playing, the command “help” will give you a list of other commands.)</p>
<p>Once you get comfortable with the code, you should begin changing and building on it to make your own game. We list a collection of suggested changes to make to the code below. It describes many improvements you could make and assigns a number of points to each change. (In general, bigger&#x2F;harder additions are worth more points.)  To get a passing score on this assignment, you must earn at least 20 points, though you should aim to earn at least 40. You can pick which improvements to make, but remember that your goal isn’t just to check off boxes by making the improvements. You want to make something that is actually a good game. (So for example, it is probably necessary to choose the option that expands your world beyond 4 rooms…)</p>
<p>The improvements are not explained in the sort of specific detail that would tell you exactly what changes they include. You have to add this functionality in a way that you think makes for a good game. For example, you have to figure out how to modify the user interface so that the new functionality can be used. (If you are adding doors that require keys to unlock them, do you just make it so you have to be carrying the key to go through the door? Or is there a specific “unlock” command? If so, you should update the “help” description to include information on how to use it.)</p>
<p>I have included an <code>examples</code> folder with compiled Python code for a few different games. There is a very simple “minotaur” game that suggests the kind of minimal game that you can get working for the first “check-in” milestone. Run it with the command:</p>
<pre><code>python3 minotaur-39.py
</code></pre>
<p>This only runs on Python 3.9. There is a second file you can use to run on Python 3.8 instead. There are some stellar compiled examples of past students’ projects. Maybe these will be inspiration for developing your own game. They do illustrate well how others have made improvements and made them fit into their own game’s story. To run them, use the <code>.pyc</code> file for your version of Python. I’m running version 3.9 so I would type</p>
<pre><code> python3 hagoromo-39.pyc
</code></pre>
<p>to run the <code>hagoromo</code> game. There is <code>zoo</code> and <code>owl</code> to try, too.</p>
<p>You should create a document that briefly describes your game and explains its gameplay. You should develop this document as you develop the game. It should include a list of all the improvements you’ve made, the points you feel you earned for each, and a brief explanation of what specifically you did for each improvement. Sometimes there will be very little to say, but if the improvement gave you freedom to choose how things would work, you should say what you chose. If you have to add a new type of monster, for example, say what type you added and what if anything is special about it.  You should also have a quick note about what code in what files was added&#x2F;modified to make this work. You are also free to make improvements that aren’t on the list of options, and if you do that you should describe them here as well. This document should explicitly enumerate and tally for us the points you have earned with your work.</p>
<p>Your project will be evaluated in several ways. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How many points did you earn from your improvements?</p>
</li>
<li><p>How well did you make the improvements you made? Did you do the minimum to make it count, or do something very challenging? Were there bugs? Were the improvements made in a way that was easy for the user to understand? Were they incorporated well into the game?</p>
</li>
<li><p>How good is the overall game? You should be trying to make a game that is actually fun to play. Pick improvements that help you achieve this and try to design the game well. Make your improvements well-integrated into the game. (For example, if you add weapons to your game, you should make it so that there are various different weapons that exist in the world so that finding a good weapon is part of playing the game. Just having a single weapon on the floor in the starting room that you pick up at the beginning of the game doesn’t add much.) Make sure someone who is new to the game can figure out how to play.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Did you make regular progress in your coding? We will have several “milestones” for this project that we’d like you to reach, and you should think of their dates as real deadlines to meet before the final submission deadline. For these intermediate deadlines you will report by demonstrating your game to us, and show us how much of the work you have completed at each stage. You will be evaluated on your progress with each of these minor deadlines, in addition to what you’ve completed by the major deadline. Start early, do not let this assignment sit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>How well documented is your code and how understandable is it? This applies both to comments in the code and to the document you’re submitting. Your code should be well-written and readable, and we should be able to figure out what you did and how you did it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some notes on the work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The starter code has each class in a separate file. It is not necessary to make a file for every class. For example, if you have classes defining particular types of items, it might be natural to put them in the same “game items” file. However, it can often be good practice to keep some things in separate files as a way of making the code more manageable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You should think ahead and have an idea of what you want your game to end up looking like before you start adding things, but you should also add things one at a time in a way that can be tested as they get added.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Leave time for general testing of the game at the end. Even once all of the technical improvements have been made, you will want to change things around a bit to make the game better. Feel free to have a friend play the game and see if they enjoy it, if they can figure out how to play, etc. We will formalize this process with the “beta test” deadline in the last week.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The starter code is meant as starter code. It is okay to change things. You should also not assume everything is done perfectly. You ideally want your program to work gracefully even if, for example, a user makes a typo while inputting a command. The starter code is reasonably good about this sort of thing, but it can certainly be improved.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Working-with-Partners"><a href="#Working-with-Partners" class="headerlink" title="Working with Partners"></a>Working with Partners</h2><p>You are allowed (even encouraged!) to work with a partner on this project. If you do so, you must both contribute roughly equal work to the project. I expect a slightly more ambitious game from you. You will need 25 points to pass and should aim for at least 50 total points (as opposed to 20 and 40 for single individuals).</p>
<p>You should also submit a brief description of who did what work. (This should be no more than a page, probably substantially shorter.) Did you sit at a computer together working? Split things up? Test each others’ code? You should describe briefly what parts each person worked on, what was worked on together, what “worked on together” meant for you, and how you coordinated your efforts.</p>
<p>This is a small enough project that coordinating the efforts of two people should not be too complicated, but if you’re interested, I would recommend using a Git repository. (These can be set up for free online, and a quick google search will give not only the needed resources but also instructions on how to use Git.)</p>
<h2 id="Deadlines"><a href="#Deadlines" class="headerlink" title="Deadlines"></a>Deadlines</h2><p>This project will include several intermediate deadlines.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Game Proposal:</strong> <em>April 17th.</em> Submit a brief text file to the Gradescope submission system. This should say who you will partner with (if anyone) and the general game idea. (The game idea is just a very basic description– two or three sentences should be plenty.)  If you are working with a partner, you should both separately submit the same proposal file.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Progress check-in:</strong> <em>Thursday, April 28th.</em> By this day you should have done the work to have earned at least 20 points, 30 ideally, though perhaps crudely implemented. Briefly show these changes to a TA or professor, either during lab, or during professor office hours, or TA evening hours. We will evaluate your progress.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Project submission:</strong> <em>Wednesday, May 5th.</em> Submit your game’s code and any of its supporting files, a description of your game and instructions for playing it, and a report of the features you implemented with a breakdown of the point total you reached.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Menu-of-improvements"><a href="#Menu-of-improvements" class="headerlink" title="Menu of improvements"></a>Menu of improvements</h2><ul>
<li><p><strong>“me” command</strong> <em>(2 points)</em>:<br>Create a command that lets the player see their current status, including their health and&#x2F;or whatever other attributes you’ve added.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>bigger world</strong> <em>(2 points)</em>:<br>The game starts with four rooms. That is not enough for much to happen in. Make the world bigger and more interesting. Give descriptions to rooms that say more than just a room number.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>“inspect” command</strong> <em>(2 points)</em>:<br>Create a command that lets the player look at items. This should display the item description. The player should be able to look at both items they see in their current location and items in their inventory.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>limited inventory</strong> <em>(2 points)</em>:<br>Make objects you’re carrying have a size or weight, and put a limit on how much you can carry.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>“drop” command</strong> <em>(2 points)</em>:<br>Make it so that the player can drop items, so that their inventory doesn’t become unreasonably large.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>weapons</strong> <em>(2 points)</em>:<br>Implement a new type of item for weapons, ones that a player can use to make themselves more formidable in battle. This will requires modifying how fights against monsters work.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>armor</strong> <em>(2 points)</em>:<br>Implement a type of item for armor.  These make it harder for a monster to kill the player.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>healing items</strong> <em>(2 points)</em>:<br>Create items that players can use to restore health. These items should only be usable once each and should disappear when used. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>item stacking</strong> <em>(2 points)</em>:<br>Make the inventory display ‘(x2)’ if there are two identical items (and so on, if there are more), rather than listing the item name twice.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>introducing monsters during play</strong> <em>(2 points)</em>:<br>Make it so that over time new monsters appear in the world.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>“wait” command</strong> <em>(2 points)</em>:<br>In the game as it is, time passes only when you move to a new room. Make it so that you can type a command that just lets time pass. Or implement a trickier version: let the user type a number so they can wait for a number of turns with only one command entry.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>regeneration</strong> <em>(2 points)</em>:<br>Have the player regenerate in some way over time. The easiest thing is to make health increase a little each turn, but there are other things you could do as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>locked chests</strong> <em>(3 points)</em>:<br>Create “chests” or other containers that cannot be opened without a key, and also the relevant keys.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>locked doors</strong> <em>(3 points)</em>:<br>Create doors that cannot be used unless first unlocked with a key, and also the relevant keys.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>containers</strong> <em>(3 points)</em>:<br>Make containers (bags, boxes, etc.)  that can hold other objects.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>victory condition</strong> <em>(3 points)</em>:<br>Create a way for the player to win the game.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>random world</strong> <em>(3 points)</em>:<br>Make the world be generated in a random way when the program is run so that it’s somewhat different each time the game is played.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>loot</strong> <em>(3 points)</em>:<br>Make it so that defeating some monsters causes useful items to appear. There should be some amount of randomness about what those items are.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>events</strong> <em>(3 points)</em>:<br>Make it so that interesting things sometimes happen. Their ocurrence can be governed by a timer or they could happen just at random.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>more monsters</strong> <em>(3 points)</em>:<br>Create several different types of monsters. They should not just have different names, but really be different in important ways.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>special rooms</strong> <em>(3 points)</em>:<br>Make rooms that have some effect on the player or monsters when they are entered.  Maybe there’s a hospital that heals you when you enter it? That sort of thing.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>complex rooms</strong> <em>(3 points)</em>:<br>Give rooms some additional attributes or behavior. Maybe they get dirty?  Or full? Or different types behave differently?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>player attributes</strong> <em>(3 points)</em>:<br>By default the only characteristic of the player is their health.  Add more attributes that affect what the player can do.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>command abbreviations</strong> <em>(1-3 points)</em>:<br>The typing needed to play a text adventure can get tedious. Usually games allow abbreviations.  This could simply just be some short, alternate commands (“inv” instead of “inventory”, etc.)  or, more ambitiously, you could accept any string that is the start of only one command. And&#x2F;or you could allow items, monsters, and other things to be abbreviated in some consistent way.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>helper</strong> <em>(4 points)</em>:<br>Create an autonomous character that is on your side and does something helpful. You should have some ability to control&#x2F;influence how they behave. Maybe you need to ask for their help or ask them to join&#x2F;follow you in your quest, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>currency</strong> <em>(4 points)</em>:<br>Create a currency for the game. There should be a way for the player to gain currency, and also useful ways for them to spend the currency. (A merchant? a store?)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>leveling up</strong> <em>(4 points)</em>:<br>Add a mechanism for “leveling up” the player. That is, as they accomplish things in the game, the player should get stronger in some way.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>crafting</strong> <em>(4 points)</em>:<br>Create some system where the player can use an item, or several items, to construct a useful item.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>magic</strong> <em>(4 points)</em>:<br>Create a system where the player has “spells” (or “abilities,” whatever best fits your theme) that they can use (possibly learned during the game). There should be some restriction on how often spells can be cast.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>characters</strong> <em>(4 points)</em>:<br>Characters are neutral beings in the game that you can talk to and interact with.  (The “talking to” can be a matter of picking one of several options of things to say from a list.) They should interact with you or the world in some way when you talk to them. This should be different than the “helper” above (that is, if you make a helper character, then you need another character to get credit for this option).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>modifying the world</strong> <em>(4 points)</em>:<br>Allow the player to modify rooms&#x2F;locations in some way, more than just by grabbing&#x2F;dropping objects. The changes they make should have a real effect on the gameplay. This could be something like lighting a candle that allows you to see the contents of the room, but only if you are carrying matches. It could be digging a hole that traps monsters. It could be turning on a faucet to flood a room that eventually floods nearby rooms. Perhaps you can make it so that the player creates new rooms or locations with an action.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>map</strong> <em>(3 to 6 points)</em>:<br>Allow the player to gain the ability to inspect a map of the world. Or give them the ability to look at a map from the start, but make it so that the contents of the map are slowly revealed (say, as rooms are explored). The map can just be “ASCII art,” a printed display.  This is worth more points if you have a larger&#x2F;complex world, or display some interesting things in each location, or limit the map in some way.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>saving the game</strong> <em>(10 points)</em> :<br>Let a player choose to save their game to come back to later. This should create a file in the folder where the program is stored (or maybe in a “saved” subfolder of that folder) with a name specified by the user. On starting the program, the user should have the option to continue from the point at which they saved, instead of creating a new game.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>graphical interface</strong> <em>(10 points)</em>:<br>Typing is annoying. Make the program work through a graphical interface instead of typed commands.  You don’t have to create pictures that actually look like the world. You can have a window, with portions dedicated to displaying the description of the current room, what monsters, are there, what items are there, etc. Within this interface, actions should be made by clicking buttons with the mouse or by hitting single keys as controls, rather than just through typing commands. Common options here are the <code>curses</code> library or the “Tk interactive” library <code>tkinter</code>.</p>

<p>In this project you will build a small ecosystem. In this ecosystem birds of various species look for food. Sometimes they find it and eat it. Other times they find it, but so does another bird. The birds then have the choice to fight for the food or to be passive. Depending on their decisions, they could get the food or not, but they could also be injured in the fight. You will create different species of birds with varying behaviors and see how those species thrive (or not) in certain situations.</p>
<p>The scenarios you’ll be investigating here are commonly talked about in a variety of fields. We’ll be focusing on the programming, but there are lots of important ideas here, and the analysis of this sort of situation is of interest to biologists, economists, mathematicians, and others. Computer simulation is only one way to go about thinking about these issues, but it is a tool that can add help greatly with this analysis (and with more complicated scenarios of a similar type).</p>
<h2 id="The-model"><a href="#The-model" class="headerlink" title="The model"></a>The model</h2><p>The system we simulate is a very simple one, without most of the complexities of the real world. The only active animals in our world will be birds. Each bird has a number representing its health, which starts at 100. If a bird eats, its health goes up. If it is injured, its health goes down. Birds also lose a small amount of health each unit of time. (This represents their normal rate of burning calories—a bird that doesn’t eat slowly gets less healthy over time.) If the health of a bird hits 0, it dies. If the health goes high—over 200—then the bird reproduces. When it reproduces, its health goes down by 100, and a new bird is created.</p>
<p>Birds find food in one of two ways. Each time step, there are 10 units of food that are found by single birds on their own, who then get to eat the food without worry. There are also 50 units of food that are contested—one bird finds the food, but another approaches before they can eat it. In cases of contested food, each bird has two options—they can be passive or aggressive. Depending on what they choose, one of the following scenarios will occur:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Two passive birds.</strong> When both birds are passive, they will engage in displays meant to get the other bird to leave, and this will continue until one bird does so. The display costs a small amount of health for each bird, and it is random which of the birds ends up with the food.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>One aggressive and one passive bird.</strong> If one bird is aggressive and the other is passive, the passive bird will flee and the aggressive bird will get the food.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Two aggressive birds.</strong> When both birds are aggressive, they will fight. One bird (chosen randomly) will win, and they will get the food. The loser instead is injured, reducing their health.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be modeling several types of birds. We’ll begin with hawks and doves. Hawks will always be aggressive, while doves will always be passive. Once we have that simulation working correctly, we’ll add other types of birds. Along the way we’ll get a bunch of interesting results.</p>
<p><strong>Programming note:</strong> The goal of this project is to show you object-oriented programming used in a particular way. As a result, we will be very precise about exactly what classes there should be, what methods those classes should have, and what those methods should do. Follow the instructions carefully.</p>
<h1 id="First-Experiment-hawks-and-doves"><a href="#First-Experiment-hawks-and-doves" class="headerlink" title="First Experiment: hawks and doves"></a>First Experiment: hawks and doves</h1><p>Our first goal is to run the simulation with just hawks and doves. In order to do this, we’ll need to write a lot of code. Your starter code file, <code>hawkdove.py</code>, contains an outline of what we will need.</p>
<p>It has the needed <code>import</code> statements, and it has a set of constants defined at the top. These constants determine the relative values of food, injuries, and displays, as well as how many of each type of bird we create at the start of the simulation. It also has the code for actually running the simulation, but that code won’t work yet. In between those things, we’ll need to add several classes, each with several methods, that will represent the world of our simulation and the birds that live within it. Follow the steps below to add these pieces.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Create a <code>World</code> class. This will represent the world as a whole. (We will only ever create one actual world object.) The initialization method should take no parameters other than <code>self</code>. The class should only have one instance variable, a list of currently-existing birds, and that list should initially be set to the empty list <code>[]</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a <code>Bird</code> class. We won’t actually create any instances of this class, but we’ll have other classes that inherit from <code>Bird</code> and represent specific types of birds. It will be useful to define some things about birds here so that we don’t need to repeat them many times later. The <code>Bird</code> initialization function should take a single parameter other than <code>self</code>, a world object. The bird should then add itself to the list of birds that exist in that world. It should also keep an instance variable storing the world that it is in, and it should have an instance variable tracking its current health, which starts at <code>100</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add an <code>eat</code> method to the <code>Bird</code> class. This method should take no additional parameters. When it is called, it should increase the bird’s health by the amount specified by the <code>foodbenefit</code> constant.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add an <code>injured</code> method to the <code>Bird</code> class. This method should take no additional parameters, and should reduce the bird’s health by the amount specified by the <code>injurycost</code> constant.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add a <code>display</code> method to the <code>Bird</code> class. This method should take no additional parameters and should reduce the bird’s health by the amount specified by the <code>displaycost</code> constant.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add a <code>die</code> method to the <code>Bird</code> class. This method should take no additional parameters and should remove the bird from its world’s bird list.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add an <code>update</code> method to the <code>Bird</code> class. This method takes no additional parameters and it represents one unit of time passing. It should reduce the bird’s health by <code>1</code> (representing calories being burned) and then should check whether the health is at or below <code>0</code>. If so, the bird should die (which you can make happen using the <code>die</code> method). We now have a <code>Bird</code> class that has all the basic functionality.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Let’s now add additional functionality to the <code>World</code> class. First, create an <code>update</code> method in this class. It should take no additional parameters, and should simply call the <code>update</code> method for each bird in the bird list. With this we now have a single method we can call that makes time pass for every individual in our simulation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add a <code>free_food</code> method to the <code>World</code> class. This represents the uncontested food that birds can find. It should take a single integer as its parameter. It should then award a free unit of food that many times. Each award of free food is done by picking a random bird from the bird list and having that bird <code>eat</code>. (Each choice of bird should be made independent of the others—it is possible a bird will get free food multiple times in a single <code>free_food</code> call if the bird is lucky.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now create <code>Dove</code> and <code>Hawk</code> classes, representing our two types of birds. These classes should inherit from <code>Bird</code>, so we won’t need to add all that much to them. Each should have a class variable called <code>species</code> that is a string representing the species of that bird. The <code>Dove</code> class should have species set to <code>&quot;Dove&quot;</code> and the <code>Hawk</code> class should have species set to <code>&quot;Hawk&quot;</code>. There is no need to add initialization functions to either class—the initialization function <code>__init__</code> in <code>Bird</code> will do just fine.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add <code>update</code> methods to <code>Dove</code> and <code>Hawk</code>. These are modifications of the method for <code>Bird</code>. They should do the same things <code>Bird</code> does. (Don’t repeat the code—use the function from <code>Bird</code>.) Then they should also reproduce if necessary. After the standard <code>update</code> (including the health reduction) these methods should check whether the dove&#x2F;hawk has health of at least <code>200</code>. If so, the health should be reduced by <code>100</code> and a new bird (of the same type) should be created (in the same world).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add a <code>defend_choice</code> method to <code>Dove</code> and <code>Hawk</code>. This method takes no input and “asks” the bird whether it will defend itself if another bird finds it with food. Doves never will, so their function should always return <code>False</code>, while hawks should have a function that always returns <code>True</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, we need to add a method that represents a hawk&#x2F;dove coming upon another bird with food. This method will be called <code>encounter</code>, and it takes as input another bird (the one that has already found the food). It should use <code>defend_choice</code> to find out if the other bird will defend itself, and then respond accordingly. A dove will run away if the other bird defends itself, having no effect on the dove, and letting the other bird eat. (Remember, you need to explicitly have the other bird eat.) If the other bird does not defend itself, both birds should display, then a random one of the two should eat the food. A hawk on the other hand will always eat if the other bird does not defend itself. If it does, the two fight with a random winner. The winner eats and the loser gets injured. Once this is done, your <code>Hawk</code> and <code>Dove</code> classes are complete.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We can now complete the <code>World</code> class. First we add a <code>conflict</code> method. This is the analogous function to <code>free_food</code>, and it creates encounters between birds over food. It should take a number parameter and make that many encounters occur. In each encounter, two (different) birds should be randomly selected. An encounter should then occur where one of the birds finds the other. (Do this by calling the <code>encounter</code> method.)  Like with <code>free_food</code>, the same bird can be chosen for multiple encounters.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add a <code>status</code> method to world. This method should count the number of birds of each species that currently exist and print a summary of that information to the terminal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We can now run our first experiments. Set <code>init_hawk</code> and <code>init_dove</code> to 50, and <code>init_defensive</code> and <code>init_evolving</code> to 0 (these are two types of birds we haven’t made yet, so we don’t want them in this experiment). Then set <code>injurycost</code>, <code>displaycost</code>, and <code>foodbenefit</code> to <code>11</code>, <code>1</code>, and <code>8</code> respectively. Run the script. The code provided at the bottom will run the experiment for <code>10000</code> units of time, at each step providing free food <code>10</code> times and contested food <code>50</code> times. At the end, you should see a mix of hawks and doves. Try changing <code>injurycost</code> to <code>7</code>. Now you should see that only hawks survive. Play around with different numbers. You should find that you can create outcomes that mix hawks and doves and outcomes that are all hawks, but no outcomes that are all doves.</p>
<h1 id="Second-Experiment-defensive-birds"><a href="#Second-Experiment-defensive-birds" class="headerlink" title="Second Experiment: defensive birds"></a>Second Experiment: defensive birds</h1><p>Next we want to add a new type of bird. This type of bird is “defensive”—if it finds food first, it will fight to defend it from other birds, but it will not attack other birds to take their food. (It will, however, display in the way doves do.) It also of course creates additional defensive birds when it reproduces. You should create a <code>Defensive</code> class to represent this bird. Remember that <code>defend_choice</code> determines what a bird does when it has already found food and another bird appears, while <code>encounter</code> determines what it does when it finds another bird already with food. Remember to avoid repeating code whenever possible!</p>
<p>When you have such a class created, set <code>init_defensive</code> to <code>50</code> so that we now have three types of birds in our experiment. Now try several experiments. Set <code>injurycost</code> to <code>10</code>, <code>displaycost</code> to <code>1</code> and <code>foodbenefit</code> to <code>12</code>. You should see that only hawks survive. If you instead change <code>foodbenefit</code> to <code>8</code>, you should see only defensive birds. Can you find settings that give a mix of defensive birds and hawks? Can you find settings where doves survive?</p>
<h1 id="Third-Experiment-evolution"><a href="#Third-Experiment-evolution" class="headerlink" title="Third Experiment: evolution"></a>Third Experiment: evolution</h1><p>Now we make a bigger change. Instead of specifying exactly what type of birds we have and how they behave, we want to allow birds to behave in a variety of ways and let them evolve over generations. We’ll get rid of doves and hawks and defensive birds. Instead we’ll use a new class, <code>Evolving</code>, that can represent birds of various kinds. We’ll let these new birds vary in two ways. One is that they will have different levels of aggression, choosing to fight more or less frequently. The other is that they’ll vary by weight, with heavier birds winning fights more often but also burning more calories over time. Then, we’ll let these birds evolve— children of a bird will have roughly the same (but not identical) attributes as the parent—and we can see how the birds change over time.</p>
<p>First, you’ll need to write <code>defend_choice</code> and <code>encounter</code>. These methods need to account for the new way birds choose whether to fight. A bird should choose to fight with a probability equal to its aggressiveness (which will always be between <code>0.0</code> and <code>1.0</code>). (Note that this is true whether encountering another bird or defending—we’re dropping the distinction we made in <code>Defensive</code>.) The <code>encounter</code> method also needs to account for the new, more complicated method of fighting. We want heavier birds to win fights more often, so we will say that if the two birds have weights <code>w1</code> and <code>w2</code>, then the probability of first bird winning is <code>w1/(w1+w2)</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Programming tip:</strong> calling <code>random.random()</code> provides a uniform random number between <code>0.0</code> and <code>1.0</code>. You can use this to make things happen with a certain probability.</p>
<p>Next you need to write <code>update</code> and <code>__init__</code>. These functions will be used to create two changes from our previous birds. The first is that heavier birds burn more calories. As a result, we want health to decrease by <code>0.4 + 0.6 * w</code> at each unit of time. (This is still 1 for the smallest birds, but it scales up as the birds get larger.)</p>
<p>The bigger change, however, will be to how reproduction works. It is no longer enough to just create another bird of the same type. We want the offspring of a successful bird to be similar to its parent, but with some variation. (This is a rough approximation of mutations that occur in nature.) You should modify the initialization function for <code>Evolving</code>. It should take one additional argument, the evolving bird’s parent (which could be <code>None</code>).  If this <code>parent</code> argument is set to <code>None</code> (this is what we use when we create the initial population of “Adam&#x2F;Eve” birds at the start of the experiment) then the <code>weight</code> and <code>aggression</code> should be chosen as floating point numbers from the allowed ranges (between <code>0.0</code> and <code>1.0</code> for <code>aggression</code> and between <code>1.0</code> to <code>3.0</code> for weight).</p>
<p>If instead, the <code>parent</code> parameter is not <code>None</code>, then we give this new bird a <code>weight</code> and <code>aggression</code> close to that of its parent by setting each attribute to that of its parent plus or minus a small random amount.  In particular, <code>weight</code> should be set to the parent’s <code>weight</code> plus a random value between <code>-0.1</code> and <code>0.1</code>. Similarly, <code>aggression</code> should be the parent’s <code>aggression</code> plus a random value between <code>-0.05</code> and <code>0.05</code>. We do, however, want these values to stay in the allowed ranges (again, from <code>0.0</code> to <code>1.0</code> for <code>aggression</code> and from <code>1.0</code> to <code>3.0</code> for <code>weight</code>.) If the random variation would put a value above&#x2F;below the allowed maximum&#x2F;minimum, then instead set it to the maximum&#x2F;minimum exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> <code>random.uniform(a,b)</code> returns a random floating point number between <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.</p>
<p>The reproduction part of <code>update</code> should use this <code>__init__</code> by creating a new <code>Evolving</code> bird, passing <code>self</code> as the parent parameter. This means that new birds will be similar to the ones that survived, with some mutation. And since the birds we create in the beginning for the initial population are built with a <code>None</code> parent, they’ll have widely varying random values.</p>
<p>Finally, we need a way to show what the evolving birds are like at a given point in time. We can’t just print counts of each type of bird anymore, so instead we’ll create a simple scatter plot of the weights and aggressiveness of the birds. A simple function for producing scatter plots, <code>plot</code>, has been provided for you. It takes two lists as parameters. The first parameter is the list of <em>x</em> coordinates of points being plotted, which will for us be the <code>weight</code> of each bird in the population.  The second parameter is a list of the corresponding <em>y</em> coordinates (in this case each bird’s aggressiveness). The two lists must correspond in order—the <em>i</em>-th <em>x</em> coordinate must correspond to the same individual as the <em>i</em>-th <em>y</em> coordinate. Add a method <code>evolvingPlot</code> to the <code>World</code> class that creates a scatter plot of all the current <code>Evolving</code> birds.</p>
<p>We can now run an experiment with these birds. At the bottom of the file, uncomment the line that makes a plot of evolving birds. Then set the initial bird counts so that the only birds we have are <code>150</code> evolving birds. Finally, set <code>injurycost</code> to <code>10</code>, <code>displaycost</code> to <code>1</code> and <code>foodbenefit</code> to <code>8</code>. When you run the script, you should see that our evolving birds naturally separate into two “species” clumps—one passive, light clump fulfilling the “dove” role, and one aggressive, heavier clump fulfilling the “hawk” role. Try varying these constants to see what is possible. You should find that some settings will result in two clumps (though one of these clumps can move around), while others result in a single clump.</p>
<h1 id="What-all-of-this-means"><a href="#What-all-of-this-means" class="headerlink" title="What all of this means"></a>What all of this means</h1><p>The above description focused on the programming, since that’s what this class is about. The phenomena that you have simulated, though, are part of a deep and interesting area of study. Game theory is the mathematical modeling and analysis of strategic interactions between rational actors. It is widely used in economics to model market interactions—11 game theorists have now won Nobel prizes in economics. Political scientists use it to model any number of things, including international relations and domestic politics.</p>
<p>Modern game theory began as a result of groundbreaking research by John von Newmann and his 1944 book with Oskar Morgenstern, though some of the basic ideas had been seen earlier in works by Cournot and others. The most famous game theorist is probably John Nash, in part due to the movie A Beautiful Mind. Nash developed the definition of Nash equilibria, the standard solution concept for games, and proved that such equilibria exist in all games. For a more detailed overview of game theory, I recommend the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">Wikipedia article</a>.</p>
<p>The game we simulated in Experiment 1, Hawk-Dove, is a special case of the game of Chicken, a standard example in economics. The Hawk-Dove version was introduced by John Maynard Smith and George Price in a 1973 paper, “The logic of animal conflict.”  Smith also introduced the idea of an “evolutionarily stable strategy,” a solution concept for games specifically tailored to modeling evolution. Again, I recommend the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(game)">Wikipedia article</a> on the game to see more explanation.</p>
<p>Games can be (and usually are) analyzed without computer simulation. A large set of mathematical tools has been developed so that one can tell what the equilibrium of a game will be without need to simulate it. However, simulation can provide a concrete means to see how the game behaves. It can also be used to answer difficult questions when the theory becomes very difficult in complicated games. For example, see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://octavia.zoology.washington.edu/publications/BergstromAndGodfreySmith98.pdf">this paper by Bergstrom and Godfrey-Smith</a>. This is an example of modern research in biology that uses computer simulation of the hawk-dove game.</p>
<p>The results of these models do really tell us something about how the world works. The mixed results of the hawk-dove simulation help explain why a variety of animals exist and behave in different ways. The fact that these mixed results disappear in certain cases, with hawks becoming dominant (but never the reverse dominance for doves) also tells us something about which animals might succeed in which sort of situation.</p>
<p>The strength of the defensive strategy also has wide-ranging implications. It has been used as an argument for why territoriality might develop among certain animals. It can even be used to explain why social norms or a sense of “ownership” might evolve. Rules that specify who should get what reduce conflict, and in some cases it can do so in a way that makes every individual benefit from following the rules, even if they are arbitrary. (Of course, there are many other potential explanations of these things as well.)</p>
<p>The simulation of evolving birds also of course has relevance to biology. You can see how the mixed equilibrium of hawks and doves can appear even if the initial animals do not fall into two separate species. It can even be used to model one way that speciation might occur, with a previous homogenous population separating into two distinct types.</p>
<p>Game theory is also used in a variety of fields in computer science. Algorithms research now includes a substantial effort to find efficient ways of analyzing games to find various sorts of equilibria. (This turns out to be a very difficult problem.) Game theory is also used to model interactions between multiple actors. This includes network protocols, peer-to-peer file sharing protocols, and any other situation where protocols are being written for multiple agents to interact. (The goal here is to make it so that self-interested participants can’t deviate from the prescribed protocol in order to take more resources for themselves.) It also has a natural home in cryptography, which routinely studies the interaction of untrustworthy agents. One member of our CS faculty has done research in this area of cryptography and would be happy to talk to you about it if you’re interested.</p>

<p>For this project, you will be working with lists and dictionaries to perform some form of data analysis. Specifically, you will be generating text based on analysis of other texts. </p>
<p>This project has two parts.  The first part is a text analyzer that reports statistics about word use in the text it processes. The second part builds from the same idea, but pays attention instead to the <em>bi-grams</em> and <em>tri-grams</em> (runs of 2 or 3 words) of the text it analyzes, training a random process.  That process generates a random text that mimics the writing of the text by which it was trained.</p>
<p>The first part will feel quite a bit like you are solving several lab homework exercises. You should work to get Part 1 working quickly.  The set-up of the first part is to help you see how a larger Python script can can be structured. It will teach you how to decompose a coding project so as to allow for incremental progress in its completion and also to enable easy testing of its components.</p>
<p>Having completed Part 1, you’ll then want work to quickly learn the ideas necessary for completing Part 2. You’ll probably also want to break that coding up into several functions like we do for Part 1, but we let you use your own judgement to do that work.</p>

<h2 id="On-text-analysis"><a href="#On-text-analysis" class="headerlink" title="On text analysis"></a>On text analysis</h2><p>There is a growing area of the study called <em>digital humanities</em> that treats human-written texts as <em>data</em>, making them subject to the same kinds of analysis that scientists and social scientists my use to reason about their objects of study. By treating a text this way a scholar may get insights into an author’s use of language. What is the structure of their prose? What word choices do they tend to make? Do they have a signature style that can be quantified in some way? Such analyses might, for example, help us identify an author of an anonymous text, or be used as evidence to support or reject hypothesized authors.</p>
<p>The first cut at such analyses looks at word frequencies. Suppose, in a 500 page text, the author used 10000 words only once. What does that say about their writing? Does that say anything about their prose? Maybe they use verbs in a passive versus and active tense.  Do their sentences tend to be long or short?  Etc. Alternatively: how many times does a character’s name appear in a certain novel?</p>
<p>The algorithms and data structures that support these kinds of analyses, it turns out, are fairly foundational and can be applied in many settings. The same techniques you might use to analyze a text, can also be used to study genetic sequences, or protein structure, and maybe even general data that makes up our files’ and programs’ sequences of bits.</p>
<p>Related to this is the question of information content, the essential make-up of text, digitally speaking. Can the document be compressed so that it uses fewer bits? Can we summarize some of its content? Can we make its ideas searchable? Can we relate it to other documents in some way?</p>
<h2 id="On-text-synthesis"><a href="#On-text-synthesis" class="headerlink" title="On text synthesis"></a>On text synthesis</h2><p>Also related to these notions of how we characterize a text digitally is a question of <em>text generation</em>. Can we use our techniques to generate novel, meaningful sequences of words? As we hear in the news, there are <em>bots</em> that post information on sites, send spam emails, and in some very near future will interact with us in text or in speech in novel ways.</p>
<p>We are in the midst of a technical revolution in this regard: deep learning and statistical techniques are able to represent parsable sentence structure in some remarkable ways and can string words together <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/10/14/can-a-machine-learn-to-write-for-the-new-yorker">so as to have seeming meaning and content.</a> Nevertheless, there is much work to be done, and every development highlights the difficulty of natural language processing and synthesis, and the huge complexity that must clearly be involved in human thought and communication.</p>
<p>For this project we build a very simple model for synthesizing sequences of words that mimiic human-written texts, albeit in a very limited way.  We build a <em>stochastic process</em> by analyzing the frequency of the third word of every three-word sequence in a text. The idea here is that, when we are reading a text (say, the words you are reading <em>right now</em>) our minds build expectations for the next word we read based on the last few words we’ve just read.</p>
<p>If you read “<em>The dog…</em>“, say, you might not be surprised if the next word is “<em>barked</em>“, or “<em>sat</em>“, or “<em>slept</em>“, and maybe even “<em>park</em>“ or “<em>house</em>“. You might not expect “<em>purred</em>“, or “<em>philosophized</em>“, or “<em>rented</em>“, and probably not “<em>candelabra</em>“ or “<em>eight</em>“.  And, maybe having then read “<em>The dog barked</em>“, you’d be surprised to see “<em>sat</em>“ next and not be surprised to see “<em>loudly</em>“ next.</p>
<p>Imagine processing the text of a novel whose main character has a faithful dog companion in a few key moments of its story.  The two-word sequence (or <em>bi-gram</em>) “<em>the dog</em>“ might occur 12 times, and have “<em>slept</em>“ follow 3 of those times, have “<em>barked</em>“ follow 5 times, have “<em>sat</em>“ follow twice, and “<em>park</em>“ follow twice.  And maybe “<em>dog barked</em>“ would have “<em>at</em>“ happen several times (even more than 6, if “<em>his dog barked</em>“ was also a common triple), but also “<em>loudly</em>“ twice, and so on.</p>
<p>Using the data structures we just learned, we could build a dictionary full of a text’s bi-grams. Each entry in the dictionary could have the list of following words and their frequencies. The dictionary would have these contents represented as below</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123; # dictionary of bi-grams, along with their following words</span><br><span class="line">  ...</span><br><span class="line">  &quot;the dog&quot;:[[&quot;slept&quot;, 3], [&quot;barked&quot;,5], [&quot;sat&quot;,2], [&quot;park&quot;,2]],</span><br><span class="line">  ...</span><br><span class="line">  &quot;dog barked&quot;:[[&quot;at&quot;,...],</span><br><span class="line">  ...</span><br><span class="line">  &quot;his dog&quot;:[[&quot;barked&quot;,...]</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>In the above, we’ve chosen to represent the occurrences of words that follow bi-grams as a dictionary whose keys are strings. Each string contains two words separated by a space. Each of these bi-grams has an associated value in the dictionary. It is the list of words that follow that bi-gram in the text, paired with the number of times that word followed that bi-gram.</p>
<p>We can turn this analysis around to generate random text.  Suppose we decided to, while writing a novel, start with the words “<em>The dog</em>“, we could then chooose where to go next in our writing totally at random. We toss a 12-sided die, choosing to type “<em>slept</em>“ if 1, 2, or 3 comes up, “<em>barked</em>“ if 4 through 8 comes up, “<em>sat</em>“ if 9 or 10, and “<em>park</em>“ if we roll an 11 or 12.  And say we rolled a 10.  We type “<em>sat</em>“ and then play the same random game to maybe choose between “<em>down</em>“ or “<em>between</em>“ or “<em>on</em>“, etc. Continuing this way, maybe we write a random novel.</p>
<h1 id="Text-analysis-with-stats-py"><a href="#Text-analysis-with-stats-py" class="headerlink" title="Text analysis with stats.py"></a>Text analysis with <code>stats.py</code></h1><p>As a warm up to analyzing the bi-grams of a text, we start by just analyzing the use of individual words. We’re going to write code that reads the words of a text, stored in a text file, and counts how many times each word appears in that text.</p>
<p>In the downloaded project folder you’ll find the starting code for this part of the assignment, the file <code>stats.py</code>. It contains a script that gets the name of the text’s file, processes the file, and then reports the frequency of occurrence of words appearing in that text. Once you’ve written everything, your program should have the kind of interaction shown below:</p>

<p>You should know that, in the above, the lines from “<code>Fair Reed</code>“ down to the line above “<code>DONE.</code>“ were entered by the user into the console.  After they hit the <code>[RETURN]</code> key, they they hit <code>[CONTROL-d]</code> to signal the end of text (this is the console’s “end of file” keystroke), and then the program produced the subsequent output.</p>
<p>Below is another run, but using a special feature of the console called <em>input redirection</em>. The <code>&lt;</code> tells the console to feed in the contents of the file <code>jabberwocky.txt</code> as if they are being typed in directly by the user. Here is that run:</p>

<p>This text file contains Lewis Carroll’s somewhat gibberish-y poem <em>Jabberwocky</em> and has lots of used-once words. There are several used twice, and the code just happens to report a few of these, including the word “<em>went</em>.”</p>
<p>As you use the code and make it work, you’ll notice that the code considers “stop punctuation”— the marks <code>.</code>, <code>!</code>, and <code>?</code> specially.  This will be useful for text synthesis, later. It ignores other punctiation marks except for the contraction mark <code>&#39;</code>, which it considers a letter of a word. It treats all letters as their lowercase.  It currently fails to properly process accented letters, ignoring them and only paying attention to <code>a</code> through <code>z</code>, <code>A</code> through <code>Z</code>.</p>
<p>For shorter entries (fewer than 10 words), it only reports a most frequent word. For medium (fewer than 100), it only reports the top 10. For longer texts, it reports the top 100. Here is an example of it processing the full text of an English translation of Gabriel García Márquez’s <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em>:</p>

<h2 id="Coding-stats-py"><a href="#Coding-stats-py" class="headerlink" title="Coding stats.py"></a>Coding <code>stats.py</code></h2><p>The starter code provided has a fully written script, but its code relies on several helper functions that have not been written.  Below I list each of these functions, giving descriptions of how each should behave. Work to complete each of these to get Part 1 working fully.</p>
<p>Many of these functions operate on either a list of strings that are words from the entered text, or else a dictionary that summarizes the number of occurrences of each word in the text. The dictionary stores the word frequencies of the text. We compute a list of the most frequently used words in the text, ordered from the most frequent to the least frequent, among those words.</p>
<p>To compute these summaries of the text, there is some pre-written code that simplifies the text that was entered. Words are made lowercase, some punctuation is removed, and most non-alphabetic characters are ignored. The exception is apostrophes, which are kept for contractions like <code>&quot;isn&#39;t&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;it&#39;s&quot;</code>. The other exception is punctuation that normally ends English sentences, namely <code>&quot;.&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;!&quot;</code>, and <code>&quot;?&quot;</code>. We refer to these as <em>stoppers</em> and a lot of the functions below sometimes ask you to treat these strings as part of a word list, but then treat them specially.</p>
<p>For example, consider this interaction:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ python3 stats.py</span><br><span class="line">READING text from STDIN. Hit ctrl-d when done entering text.</span><br><span class="line">Well, hello there, Jim. *87&amp;#@* Hello!</span><br><span class="line">DONE.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Processing that single line of text, the code creates the word list:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">[&quot;well&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;there&quot;, &quot;jim&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;!&quot;]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The text is simplified to a list of lowercase words and the stopper punctuation marks. The word frequency summary of this text will be the dictionary:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;&#x27;well&#x27;:1, &#x27;hello&#x27;:2, &#x27;there&#x27;:1, &#x27;jim&#x27;:1&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Finally, if we were to list the two most frequently occurring words in this text, ordered from most- to least-frequent, that could be the list</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">[&#x27;hello&#x27;, &#x27;there&#x27;]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>But because two other words have equal frequency to <code>&#39;there&#39;</code>, these two other lists would be equally valid</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">[&#x27;hello&#x27;, &#x27;well&#x27;]</span><br><span class="line">[&#x27;hello&#x27;, &#x27;jim&#x27;]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The order is arbitrary, and depends on how the analysis happens to order words that occur the same number of times.</p>
<p>With this information in mind, below we list each of those functions you need to write to complete this part of the assignment.</p>
<h2 id="Write-wordFrequencies"><a href="#Write-wordFrequencies" class="headerlink" title="Write wordFrequencies"></a>Write <code>wordFrequencies</code></h2><p>Write a function <code>def wordFrequencies(wordList)</code> that takes a list of strings. These strings are all the words in the text, along with the stopper punctuation marks. The function should build and return the word frequencies dictionary summarizing the occurrences of words in the text.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; wf = wordFrequencies([&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;there&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;!&quot;])</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; wf</span><br><span class="line">&#123;&#x27;hello&#x27;:2, &#x27;there&#x27;:1&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The list of punctuation marks considered to end sentences is given by the script variable <code>STOPPERS</code> and defined at the very top of the <code>stats.py</code> script. These strings should not be counted and should not appear in the dictionary.</p>
<h2 id="Write-wordCount"><a href="#Write-wordCount" class="headerlink" title="Write wordCount"></a>Write <code>wordCount</code></h2><p>Write a function <code>def wordCount</code> that takes a word frequencies dictionary <code>freqs</code> as its only parameter. It should return <em>a pair</em> of integer values.  The first component of the pair should be the size of the whole text in number of words. The second component of the pair should be the number of <em>distinct</em> words used in the text. The first is often called the <em>word count</em> of the text. The second is often called the <em>vocabulary size</em> of the text.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; wf = wordFrequencies([&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;there&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;!&quot;])</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; count,vocabSize = wordCount(wf)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; print(count,vocabSize,sep=&quot;,&quot;)</span><br><span class="line">3,2</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>This, I believe, is the first time in this semester’s material where we have introduced a Python pair.  Pairs are an easy concept to understand. They are like a list, except their components cannot be modified. For example:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_pair = (3,7)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_pair[0]</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_pair[1]</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; len(my_pair)</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_pair[0] = 4</span><br><span class="line">Traceback (most recent call last):</span><br><span class="line">  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;</span><br><span class="line">TypeError: &#x27;tuple&#x27; object does not support item assignment</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Python has a very convenient syntax for extracting the components of a pair. Instead of writing code like</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_pair = (3,7)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; first = my_pair[0]</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; second = my_pair[1]</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; print(first, second)</span><br><span class="line">3 7</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

The size of the list requested is given by <code>howMany</code>, and that parameter is assumed to be a non-negative integer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the list returned should be organized so that the string at location 0 is a word that occurs the most, with the subsequent items in the list ordered by decreasing frequency.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; wf = wordFrequencies([&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;there&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;!&quot;])</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; topWordsByFrequeny(wf,1)</span><br><span class="line">[&#x27;hello&#x27;]</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; topWordsByFrequency(wf,2)</span><br><span class="line">[&#x27;hello&#x27;, &#x27;there&#x27;]</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; topWordsByFrequency(wf,0)</span><br><span class="line">[]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Note that there might be ties in word frequencies. Consider this use:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; wf = wordFrequencies([&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;there&quot;, &quot;goodbye&quot;, &quot;abe&quot;])</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; twbf = topWordsByFrequency(wf,2)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>In the above, <code>twbf</code> could contain <code>hello</code> and <code>there</code>, or <code>hello</code> and <code>abe</code>, or <code>goodbye</code> and <code>there</code>, etc. Any two of those four words are the top two most-frequently occurring words.</p>
<h2 id="Write-rankedWordReport"><a href="#Write-rankedWordReport" class="headerlink" title="Write rankedWordReport"></a>Write <code>rankedWordReport</code></h2><p>In the reporting of the most frequently occurring words by <code>stats.py</code>, we rank the words, say, from 1 to 100 (if the text is long enough).  We use a function <code>rankedWordReport</code> to format that report.</p>
<p>Write the function <code>def rankedWordReport(ranking,topWordsList,freqs)</code>.  The first parameter <code>ranking</code> is a positive integer giving the rank of the word to report, The second parameter <code>topWordsList</code> is the most frequent words, a list of strings starting with the top ranked word, ordered by decreasing frequency. The third parameter <code>freqs</code> is the word frequencies dictionary. The function should return a string like below</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&quot;1. the:1234&quot;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The format of the string should be the ranking, followed by a period, followed by a space, followed by the word, followed by a colon character, followed by the number of occurrences of that word.  In that example, we see that the word “<em>the</em>“ occurred 1234 times.  This means that <code>topWordsList[0]</code> is “<em>the</em>“ and that <code>freqs[&quot;the&quot;]</code> equals <code>1234</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Write-numWordsWithFrequency"><a href="#Write-numWordsWithFrequency" class="headerlink" title="Write numWordsWithFrequency"></a>Write <code>numWordsWithFrequency</code></h2><p>Write a function <code>def numWordsWithFrequency(freqDict,freq)</code> that takes a word frequencies dictionary <code>freqDict</code> and a positive integer <code>freq</code>.

For example a call with <code>freq</code> of <code>1</code> would tell you how many words are used only once in the text.</p>

<h1 id="Text-synthesis-with-chats-py"><a href="#Text-synthesis-with-chats-py" class="headerlink" title="Text synthesis with chats.py"></a>Text synthesis with <code>chats.py</code></h1><p>The coding work described for <code>stats.py</code> pays attention to single word statistics in a text. Here, we instead consider runs of words in texts.  We process a text and pay attention to its <em>bigrams</em>, each consecutive pair of words in the text, and also its <em>trigrams</em>, each consecutive triple of words in the text.</p>
<p>Consider this excerpt from the <em>Odyssey</em>:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&quot;So I spake, and quickly they hearkened to my words.

In that same hour I suffered myself to forget the hard</span><br><span class="line">behest of Circe, in that she bade me in nowise be armed; but I did</span><br><span class="line">on my glorious harness and caught up two long lances in my hands,</span><br><span class="line">and went on the decking of the prow, for thence methought that</span><br><span class="line">Scylla of the rock would first be seen, who was to bring woe on my</span><br><span class="line">company. Yet could I not spy her anywhere, and my eyes waxed weary</span><br><span class="line">for gazing all about toward the darkness of the rock.&quot;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>We have the sequence of bigrams:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">so i</span><br><span class="line">i spake</span><br><span class="line">spake and</span><br><span class="line">and quickly</span><br><span class="line">...</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>And we have the sequence of trigrams:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">so i spake</span><br><span class="line">i spake and</span><br><span class="line">spake and quickly</span><br><span class="line">and quickly they</span><br><span class="line">quickly they hearkened</span><br><span class="line">...</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Among the bigrams we see that several start with “<em>to</em>“, namely</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">to my</span><br><span class="line">to bring</span><br><span class="line">to forget</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>And among the trigrams we see that two start with the bigram “<em>on my</em>“</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">on my glorious</span><br><span class="line">on my company</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>We could say that the word “<em>to</em>“ has three <em>followers</em> in that excerpt: “<em>my</em>“, “<em>bring</em>“, and “<em>forget</em>“. We could also say that the bigram “<em>on my</em>“ has two followers “<em>glorious</em>“ and “<em>company</em>“.</p>
<p>If we examine a much larger text, then we can get a much richer collection of bigrams and trigrams. Furthermore, there will be a wealth of followers of words and bigrams.</p>
<p>Write the code for <code>chats.py</code>, a program that processes lines of text and builds a dictionary of bigram and trigram patterns it sees in that text. More specifically, each entry in that dictionary has as its search key either a word (like “<em>to</em>“) or a bigram (like “<em>on my</em>“). And then each key’s associated value is a <em>collection</em> of its followers. So, processing the text in the file <code>odyssey.txt</code> included in this folder, we’d get a dictionary that included these entries:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">to: the, Erebus, her, Scylla&#x27;s, mourn, my, forget, bring, ...</span><br><span class="line">on my: company, men</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>In processing the text in this way, you should also pay attention to the stoppers. These are the punctuation marks “.”, “?”, and “!” that end English sentences and get treated as words by our code. Words that follow stoppers can be seen as possible starts to sentences.</p>
<p>When you process the text to register its bigrams and trigrams, we consider stoppers as participants in a bigram or trigram. This means, for example, that we will keep track of all words that follow a period mark “.” as a bigram entry. So, looking up “.” in our bigram&#x2F;trigram mdictionary of <code>odyssey.txt</code>, we have the entry</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">.: for, and, not, her, up, thereby, verily, up, but, ...</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>because these are the first words of all sentences following a period in that file. We furthermore, artificially treat the first line in any text as having followed a sentence ending with a period.  A file that starts with “<em>Lady Circe spoke unto me…</em>“ will instead have the dictionary entry</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">.: lady, for, and, not, her, up, thereby, verily, up, but, ...</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>We’d also see that, when “and” startsa sentence, that it is followed by several words. We have the trigram entry</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">. and: in, therein, thereon, looking, there, the, </span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Once this dictionary of word followers and bigram followers is built, we now have a way of generating semi-gibberish! I’ll call this gibberish a <em>chat.</em></p>
<p>To start a chat, we pick a random word that’s a follower of “.” in our dictionary. Maybe that’s “<em>and</em>“. To pick the next word, we look up the bigram “<em>. and</em>“ in our dictionary, and pick one of its random followers. Maybe we choose “<em>in</em>“. And so then we work with the bigram “<em>and in</em>“ and see that it has the follower “<em>the</em>“. Continuing we see that “<em>in the</em>“ has a bunch of followers, so we pick one at random.  And so forth. This process might then give us this paragraph:</p>

<p>It’s not great, but it almost reads as something poignant!</p>
<p>Applying the same technique to a longer text, things may get <em>a little</em> better because the process has been trained on more data. Here’s a random result that comes from training such a process with <code>hundred_years.txt</code>:</p>

<p>In any case, write the code that processes a text and generates a chat using this random following word process. I’ve provided only a skeleton of that script within the starter code <code>chats.py</code>. That code reads in the text, line by line, and creates a word and stopper list of strings, just as we did for Part 1. Your job is to complete this code. It relies on you writing two functions <code>train</code> and <code>chat</code> as described below. The function <code>train</code> builds a digest of a text, summarizing what words tend to follow each bigram that occurs in the text.</p>
<p>Below we describe two different versions of <code>chats.py</code>.  The first version does not pay attention to the frequency of followers, and so makes a less accurate digest of the text. The second versions include follower frequency information in the digest, allowing a more statistically accurate generation of chatted text. This requires a slightly more sophisticated way of making a random word choice.  We detail all this below.</p>
<p>The second version is a bit more of a challenge and is a <strong>BONUS version</strong> of the assignment. Should you choose to write the second version, I encourage you to get the required first version working first.</p>
<h2 id="Coding-chats-py"><a href="#Coding-chats-py" class="headerlink" title="Coding chats.py"></a>Coding <code>chats.py</code></h2><p>Below I describe the two functions you need to write to complete Part 2, a function <code>train</code> that processes a text and a function <code>chat</code> that generates text from that training. Unlike Part 1, I don’t prescribe a bunch of smaller helper functions for you to write that get those two functions written. Nevertheless, I strongly encourage you to write the code in the form of several short functions that serve <code>train</code> and <code>chat</code>. I’m just giving you the chance to determine on your own what those helper functions should be.</p>
<h2 id="Write-train"><a href="#Write-train" class="headerlink" title="Write train"></a>Write <code>train</code></h2><p>Write the function <code>def train(wordList)</code> this is the Part 2 equivalent of the first part’s <code>wordFrequencies</code> function. It takes the list of words and stoppers in the text, as a list of strings. It should return a dictionary whose keys are either single words or bigrams. Each entry should represent all possible bigrams that start with that single word or all possible trigrams that start with that bigram. The data associated with each key in the dictionary should be that word’s&#x2F;bigram’s list of follower words. In the case of a bigram key, the string is just two words separated by a space.</p>
<p>In the above description, we consider stopper punctuation marks as keys or as parts of a bigram. The first word in the text should be considered a follower of all the stoppers. If the last word in the list is not a stopper, then it should have an entry with “.” as one of its followers.</p>
<p>If the text was something like “Hello, I must be going. Goodbye. Well hello again!” then the dictionary would have these listed entries:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;.&#x27;: [&#x27;hello&#x27;, &#x27;goodbye&#x27;, &#x27;well&#x27;],</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;!&#x27;: [&#x27;hello&#x27;],</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;?&#x27;: [&#x27;hello&#x27;],</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;hello&#x27;:[&#x27;i&#x27;, &#x27;again&#x27;],</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;i&#x27;:[&#x27;must&#x27;],</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;must&#x27;:[&#x27;be&#x27;],</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;be&#x27;:[&#x27;going&#x27;],</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;going&#x27;:[&#x27;.&#x27;],</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;goodbye&#x27;:[&#x27;.&#x27;],</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;well&#x27;:[&#x27;hello&#x27;],</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;again&#x27;:[&#x27;!&#x27;],</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;hello i&#x27;:[&#x27;must&#x27;],</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;i must&#x27;:[&#x27;be&#x27;],</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;must be&#x27;:[&#x27;going&#x27;],</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;be going&#x27;:[&#x27;.&#x27;],</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;. goodbye&#x27;:[&#x27;.&#x27;],</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;. well&#x27;:[&#x27;hello&#x27;],</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;well hello&#x27;:[&#x27;again&#x27;],</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;hello again&#x27;:[&#x27;!&#x27;]</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Note that the first 11 of these entries are “word followers”, describing bigrams in the text. The remaining entries are “bigram followers”, describing trigrams that occur in the text.  Note that there is no bigram entry for <code>again !</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Write-chat"><a href="#Write-chat" class="headerlink" title="Write chat"></a>Write <code>chat</code></h2><p>Write a procedure <code>def chat(biTriDict,lineWidth,numLines)</code> that takes the bigram&#x2F;trigram dictionary <code>biTriDict</code> as produced by <code>trainChat</code> along with some paramters for formatting the chatted text. The procedure should perform the random process described above to generate a random text (or “chat”) based on the training data.</p>
<p>To start a random chat, it should pick a random follower from the word entry for “.”. And then it should try to pick a follower from the bigram entry for “.” and that word. This leads to the first two words of the chat. Generating the next words continues in this way, by keeping track of the last two words that were generated. In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the last two words are <code>w1</code> and <code>w2</code> (where either could be a stopper), pick a random follower from the list associated with that bigram. This would involve looking up the key <code>w1 + &quot; &quot; + w2</code> in the dictionary, and choosing a random word from that list.</li>
<li>If there is no entry for that bigram, or only one word was generated so far, pick a random follower from the list associated with the last word that was just generated.</li>
<li>If there is no entry for the last word, or if no words have been generated yet, pick a random follower from the list associated with the stopper “.”</li>
</ul>
<p>To generate a random choice, we’ve imported Python’s <code>random</code> package at the top of the file. You can have Python pick a random list element with <code>random.choice</code> like so:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; random.choice([&#x27;the&#x27;,&#x27;choice&#x27;,&#x27;is&#x27;,clear&#x27;])</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;is&#x27;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The other two parameters <code>lineWidth</code> and <code>numLines</code> should be used to format the output of the chat. If the total number of characters (including spaces) generated on the current line of text of the chat has just exceeded <code>lineWidth</code>, then the next chatted word should appear on the next line. If we generate a stopper and the total number of lines with output so far with the chat has exceeded <code>numLines</code>, then we stop the chat generation process.</p>
<h1 id="BONUS-train-better-to-chat-better"><a href="#BONUS-train-better-to-chat-better" class="headerlink" title="BONUS: train better to chat better"></a>BONUS: train better to chat better</h1><p>The above functionality doesn’t quite give us what we want. It treats all followers as having equal possibility in the random text generation.  If there is a typical follower word of a bigram, one that appears a 100 times, and there is a rare follower of that same bigram, maybe occurring once, both are given equal weight by using <code>random.choice</code>.</p>
<p>To make this a little more concrete, suppose we processed the text of a large novel about a boy who runs, and runs well, but faces some struggles in becoming a good runner. Maybe he runs a bunch of races and, in one race he falls and gets hurt. He is so devastated that he quits the race and cries terribly over it. But the struggle is real, he rethinks his approach to running, overcomes some issues, and then just gets better and better.</p>
<p>Digesting this story with <code>train</code>, maybe the entry for the bigram <code>the boy</code> would be something like</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#x27;the boy&#x27;:[&#x27;ran&#x27;,&#x27;fell&#x27;,&#x27;won&#x27;,&#x27;wept&#x27;,&#x27;ate&#x27;,&#x27;lost&#x27;, ...]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>But maybe he ran a lot, won a lot, and just fell and wept once.  The generated chat might then tell a tale of a voracious, despondent, clumsy running boy. This is because “wept” and “fell” would be just as likely as “ran” and “won”. This is interesting, maybe, but for certain texts this might lead top some haywire sentences becoming all too common.</p>
<p>Let’s enhance our dictionary to mimic the information we kept in Part 1 for the list of followers. Let’s have each possible following word <strong>keep a count</strong> of how many times it followed a word or a bigram.  Rather than having an entry tell us a list of followers, let’s instead have it be a list of each word along with a count.</p>
<p>If the trigram “the boy ran” appears 100 times, “the boy won” appeared 12 times, “the boy fell” twice, and “the boy wept” only once, then we want the entry to be like this</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#x27;the boy&#x27;:[[&#x27;ran&#x27;,100],[&#x27;fell&#x27;,2],[&#x27;won&#x27;,12],[&#x27;wept&#x27;,1], ...]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>This digest has better information about the structure of the text.</p>
<h2 id="Write-trainBetter"><a href="#Write-trainBetter" class="headerlink" title="Write trainBetter"></a>Write <code>trainBetter</code></h2><p>Write a function <code>def trainBetter(wordList)</code> that builds and returns this improved dictionary. Change the main <code>chats,py</code> script to use it instead.</p>
<h2 id="Write-chatBetter"><a href="#Write-chatBetter" class="headerlink" title="Write chatBetter"></a>Write <code>chatBetter</code></h2><p>With this better text digest, we can probably now generate better random chats. Write a function <code>def chatBetter(biTriDict,lineWidth,numLines)</code> that assumes that <code>biTriDict</code> was built using <code>trainBetter</code>. The key change is that the call to choose the next word, something like</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">nextWord = random.choice(biTriDict[w1 + &quot; &quot; + w2])</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>needs to be changed to work with this frequency information.  Suppose that <code>w1</code> is <code>&quot;the&quot;</code> and <code>w2</code> is <code>&quot;boy&quot;</code>, and the entry for <code>&quot;the boy&quot;</code> is this info:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#x27;the boy&#x27;:[[&#x27;ran&#x27;,100],[&#x27;fell&#x27;,2],[&#x27;won&#x27;,12],[&#x27;wept&#x27;,1]]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Then, to choose a next word in a way that respects these frequencies we pick a random integer from 1 to 115. This can be done in Python with</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">r = random.randint(1,115)</span><br><span class="line">print(r)     # Outputs some number from 1 to 115.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>If the random number chosen is one of 1..100, then we output “ran”. If it’s 101 or 102, then we output “fell”. If one of 103..114, then we output “won”. And, finally, if the random number Python chooses is 105, we output “wept”.</p>
<p>Once you’ve figured this out, Change the main <code>chats,py</code> script to use <code>chatBetter</code> instead.</p>
<h1 id="What-to-hand-in"><a href="#What-to-hand-in" class="headerlink" title="What to hand in"></a>What to hand in</h1><p>On Gradescope, there will be two problems named <code>[PJ2] stats</code> and <code>[PJ2] chats</code> where you can upload <code>stats.py</code> and <code>chats.py</code>, respectively. These will not be autograded, but we will use them to inspect and give feedback on your work.</p>
<p>In addition to submitting the code, I’d like you to <strong>include sample output</strong> for each of the sample <code>.txt</code> files included in this folder.  You can do that in a terminal by using <em>output redirection</em> but with the character <code>&gt;</code>. This is similar to input redirection with <code>&lt;</code>. If, for example, you type</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">python3 stats.py &lt; sonnets.txt &gt; sonnets_stats.txt</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>then you will get a file named <code>sonnets_stats.txt</code> that has the statistics generated by the run of <code>stats.py</code> on the file <code>sonnets.txt</code>. If instead you type</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">python3 chats.py &lt; sonnets.txt &gt; sonnets_chats.txt</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>then you will get a file of the random chat output by your <code>chats.py</code> program, and trained on the file <code>sonnets.txt</code>.</p>
<p>Gradescope will allow you to upload all these <code>.txt</code> files with your <code>.py</code> file.</p>
<p>If, also, you want to tell us a bit more about your work, and document any other files, quirks, problems, or output of you program, you can include a file named <code>README.txt</code> that documents these aspects of your project. Include that same <code>README.txt</code> file with both the <code>stats.py</code> submission and the <code>chats.py</code> submission.</p>
<p>So, in total, you should</p>
<ul>
<li>submit <code>stats.py</code> and sample output files <code>.txt</code> for Part 1</li>
<li>submit <code>chats.py</code> and sample output files <code>.txt</code> for Part 2, and</li>
<li>(optionally) submit a text file named <code>README.txt</code>.</li>

<p>This first project has you inventing a family of different <em>cellular automata</em>.  A cellular automata simulation is one that is applied to a two-dimensional grid of <em>cells</em>, where each cell stores an integer value, the cell’s <em>state</em>. With each tick of the simulation’s clock, the grid of cells update their state value by applying a simple rule. The rule specifies how it should calculate its next state from its previous state. This calculation is a <em>local</em> one. A cell changes according to its own state and the state of its immediate neighbor cells in the grid.</p>
<p>Despite this simplicity, the grid’s entire state can evolve in very interesting ways over time. You can, for example, devise calculation rules that perform image and shape analysis of the grid’s initial state pattern.</p>
<h2 id="Set-Up"><a href="#Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="Set Up"></a>Set Up</h2><p>Download the project’s source code as a ZIP package using the link below:</p>
<p>• <a href="project1.zip"><strong>Project 1</strong> package</a></p>
<p>Have it unpack as a folder named <code>project1</code>, say, within your <code>Desktop</code> folder. In that project folder, you will see a number of <code>.py</code> source files for the Python program that you will be working with. To run the program, bring up terminal console and type the commands</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">cd Desktop/project1</span><br><span class="line">python3 life.py</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>If everything is set-up correctly with Python, the program will bring up a window that shows a grid of cells. On some installations or on some systems, you will get an error, something like the following</p>
<p><img src="/121-S23/images/no-tk.jpg"></p>
<p>In these situations, Python is complaining that you are missing a needed Python module called <code>tkinter</code>. This module helps us create a window, draw shapes in that window, and allow the user to click on that window.  To fix this situation for your Python set-up, you can enter the console command:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">pip3 install tkinter</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Having done this, the command <code>python3 life.py</code> should be able to open a window and show the program’s grid of cells.</p>
<p>In addition to the displayed grid of cells, there is a color bar shown at the top. The program is prepared to execute the rules of the mathematician John Conway’s cellular automata, one he called “The Game of Life”. If you select one of the colors in the color bar, you can then paint that color onto the cells of the grid. Having done that painting, you can run the Game of life simulation by hitting <code>[SPACE]</code> a few times.  This will change the pattern of colored cells, and how that grid changes is described just below.</p>
<p>In any case, congratuations! You have created life. Read on. </p>
<h1 id="Conway’s-Game-of-Life"><a href="#Conway’s-Game-of-Life" class="headerlink" title="Conway’s Game of Life"></a>Conway’s Game of Life</h1><p><img src="/121-S23/images/life-grid.jpg" alt="A view of the Project 1 window."></p>
<p>The Game of Life is not actually a game at all, not in the usual sense. It is at most a game played by one person, there’s no strategy, and the rules don’t offer a player any choices like a normal game would. Rather, the Game of Life is a simulation of an artificial world, the world of the grid, governed by a very simple mathematical rule. An execution of the Game of Life consists of setting up the initial state of the world and then applying the rule to determine the next state of the world (the next “generation”). By successively applying this rule to the world, computing its state from one generation to the next, some interesting behavior arises.</p>
<p>In the Game of Life, the world is a grid of cells like you see in the Python program’s display. Each cell has a state associated with it. In the original Game of Life, the state of a cell could either be “living” or “dead”. In this version, the state of a cell is an integer ranging from 0 to 100.</p>
<p>Feel free to paint on the grid with the mouse using the currently selected color. White is 100. Violet through red is 99 through 1. We say that any such cell, one with a state value from 1 to 100, is “living”. Cells that are black have the state value of 0. We say that these cells are “dead”.</p>
<p>Once you’ve set up the initial state of the world, painting cells as living, you can then run a step of Conway’s game, changing the grid’s cells’ state. Hit the <em>[SPACE]</em> bar on the keyboard once. Some live cells stay alive and others die. Some dead cells come alive. Hit the space bar again to see the next generation of cells. And again.</p>
<p>The rule for how the grid changes is deterministic. The next generation’s pattern of living and dead cells is entirely determined by the prior generation’s pattern, The calculation for determining which cells live, and which cells die, is simple. With each step a cell counts the number of living cells in the eight cells immediately surrounding it. In the case where a cell is alive, it remains alive in the next generation if it has two or three living neighbors. Otherwise it dies. If instead a cell is dead, it will be come alive with a step if it has 3 living neighbors. Otherwise it remains dead.</p>
<p>Try some simple patterns out to test these rules. A good one to try is a row of three live cells surrounded by dead cells. This is a “blinker.” It cycles between two states—a horizontal strip of three, and a vertical strip of three. Another simple one is a 2x2 square called a pod. There are also gliders, spinners, clocks, loaves, hives, spaceships, …</p>
<p>There has been tremendous effort in studying Conway’s Game of Life, and a number of rich discoveries have been made. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Wikipedia article</a> for it serves as a decent starting point, should you want to learn more about it, and it is a good introduction to cellular automata in general.</p>
<h1 id="The-Python-Code"><a href="#The-Python-Code" class="headerlink" title="The Python Code"></a>The Python Code</h1><p>The code for the program is made up of three parts. There is <code>life.py</code>, which runs the main program, but it is pretty minimal. It relies almost entirely on <code>Grid.py</code>, which describes the program’s display of, and the user’s possible interaction with, the grid of cells. This is a fairly large Python file that you won’t need to understand to complete this assignment (though do feel free to look at it). Instead, you will be extending the code in the file <code>rules.py</code>. This contains a description of grid rules that can be used to run the program. For example, it contains the definition of a function <code>conway</code> that exactly describes Conway’s cell rule. Take a moment to look at this file, find the <code>conway</code> function, and then see how it implements the cellular behavior.</p>
<p>Each time that you press the space bar, this function gets executed once for each cell in the world.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you’ve noticed a few things when inspecting this code. First off, <code>conway</code> is a function whose sole responsibility is to return an integer value that represents the next state of the cell it’s working with at that moment. In order to compute the cell’s next state, it has access to the current state of the cell (the parameter <code>cntr</code>) and the current state of that cell’s eight immediate neighbors (the parameter <code>nbrs</code>). That second parameter is an object that consists of those eight state values. They are accessible with <code>nbrs.N</code>, <code>nbrs.NE</code>, <code>nbrs.E</code>, and so on. With these values and some additional calculations and logic, the value of the next state of a cell is computed and returned.</p>
<h1 id="Image-Processing"><a href="#Image-Processing" class="headerlink" title="Image Processing"></a>Image Processing</h1><p><img src="/121-S23/images/reed-grid.jpg"></p>
<p>Instead of simulating life, it’s possible to come up with all sorts of rules for computing the states of cells based on their previous states. One of the more useful application areas is image processing. In image processing, you take the digital version of a photo and manipulate it, either to enhance it’s quality, mess with it, analyze it, etc. Many of the techniques for modifying an image can be performed by local pixel rules, where you compute the tone of a pixel based on the tone values of it and its neighboring pixels). Blurring and sharpening an image are two classic examples of this.</p>
<p>To play with this feature in the program, quit the simulation demo by pressing the <code>q</code> key. We can instead run a grid simulation within the python interpreter. To do so, type the following:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; from Grid import Grid</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; from rules import *</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; Grid(negative,pattern=&#x27;images/reed-square.pgm&#x27;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The program runs with a finer grid whose cells are loaded with the pixels of a greyscale image of Eliot Hall. In this mode, black has the value 0, white has the value 255, and greys have in-between values.</p>
<p>This also sets up the <code>negative</code> rule for the grid’s cells, rather than the <code>conway</code> rule. This rule makes the picture appear as its negative’s image. It is a very simple rule. With one tap of the space bar, the new value of a pixel 255 minus its prior value. You can find this rule as the function <code>negative</code> in <code>rules.py</code>.</p>
<p>Another good rule to try is <code>blur</code>. This computes a weighted average of each cell’s four compass-point neighbors <code>nbrs.N</code>, <code>nbrs.E</code>, <code>nbrs.S</code>, and <code>nbrs.W</code>. Hit ‘q’ to end the <code>negative</code> simulation and then, still within Python, type</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; Grid(blur,pattern=&#x27;images/reed.pgm&#x27;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>This loads a larger, rectangular image of Eliot Hall.</p>
<p>With the <code>blur</code> rule each cell computes a weighted average of its four compass-point neighbors. The next state of the cell is just the average of itself and the average of its four neighbors. The effect is a smoothing of the details of the image, giving them softer transitions from light to dark. After a few steps, we get a blurred image, as if the camera used was not in focus.</p>
<h1 id="Making-New-Rules"><a href="#Making-New-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Making New Rules"></a>Making New Rules</h1><p>You can add your own cell rules to the program. Just create a new function definition to <code>rules.py</code>, mimicking my examples.  A rule is a function that takes the center cell value <code>cntr</code> and the 8 neighboring cell values as an object <code>nbrs</code>. Using these parameters on the color grid it returns an integer from 0 to 100. The <code>Grid</code> and other support programs can call this function to compute that rule’s behavior on the grid. If it is instead acting on the greys of the sample images, then it should return an integer from 0 to 255. You can run the grid program on the image, specify your new image rule, and then apply its effect.</p>
<p>The goal of this assignment is for you to write the code for <strong>eight</strong> functions like <code>conway</code> and <code>blur</code> There is a menu of suggestions at the end of this assignment description that specify what those rules should be.  The menu of possible rules you can construct is fairly rich.  It is surprising what can be done with just a little bit of clever coding.</p>
<h1 id="The-Assignment"><a href="#The-Assignment" class="headerlink" title="The Assignment"></a>The Assignment</h1><p>In the file <code>rules.py</code>, devise a series of cellular automata and image processing rules. You are to write eight rules, six from the required list below, and the remaining two of your choosing. You should do the required six first, and quickly, so that you gain experience with how the cellular automata rules work. Then make your two “programmer’s choice” behaviors directed and interesting. I’ll give you some suggestions in lecture and in lab for what other rules are possible.</p>
<p>In a new file named <code>demo.py</code> devise a demonstration of your eight rules similar to my demonstration code in <code>life.py</code>. Your description should give us a brief sense of what rule we are seeing, and how to set up and run your demonstration, if need be. We describe making demos further below.</p>
<p>Beyond the coding above, you should have ample and useful comments in your <code>rules.py</code> file that describe each function definition at an appropriate level of detail. Same goes for each of the <code>Grid</code> calls in <code>demo.py</code>.</p>
<p>You will be graded on the quality and correctness of your code, the intricacy of your rules, and on the clarity of your descriptions and comments.</p>
<h1 id="Menu-of-Required-Rules"><a href="#Menu-of-Required-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Menu of Required Rules"></a>Menu of Required Rules</h1><p>Below we give three categories of prescribed rules. You are to implement two rules from each category. And then there is a fourth “Programmer’s Choice” category where you have the option of inventing your own rules to make into Python code that runs on the grid.  You are to implement two of these in addition to the six prescribed ones.  This should lead you to writing eight different rules.</p>
<h2 id="Life-Rules"><a href="#Life-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Life Rules."></a><strong>Life Rules.</strong></h2><p><em>Pick two grid simulation rules and implement them.</em></p>
<p>Implement two of the life-like behaviors below. In some cases, it’s more natural to consider a cell as having only four neighbors, to the <code>N</code>, <code>E</code>, <code>S</code>, and <code>W</code>, rather than the full eight.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Have the color of the cell represent its age.  Perhaps have it die at 100.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Have live cells be white, and have dead cells leave a color trace that “decays” from violet to red, then finally to black. The decay happens with each successive step of the simulation. The trace should not affect the white cells’ life simulation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Have the grid instead simulate a <em>sandpile automata</em>. In a sandpile, the state of a cell gives the height of a “pile of sand grains” sitting on that cell. With each step, a cell “fires” if it has four or more grains of sand on it. When it fires, it gives one grain of sand to each of its four compass point neighbors—one to the north, one to the east, one to the south, and one to the west. Its own pile drops by four grains as a result.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For option #3 just above, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://people.reed.edu/~davidp/">Dave Perkinson’s</a> sandpile pages cover a number of aspects of this kind of system, and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://people.reed.edu/~davidp/divisors_and_sandpiles/">mathematics</a> that relates to its study. He has a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://people.reed.edu/~davidp/grant/">web simulation</a> that you can run. When it loads click on the <em>Go</em> button just right of the <code>n Grains Each Cell</code> line and you’ll see the simulation’s behavior.  A good demo of this involves placing a ton of grains of sands in the center cell and watching that tall pile topple and spread to the other cells.</p>
<p>Note that our above description of sandpile behavior does not quite line up with how the grid rules are devised. In the description a cell fires by adding grains to its neighbors. In our rule system, however, a cell’s rule only has control over its own cell, and not over the neighboring cells that it reasons about. This means that the sandpile rule function, in our simulation, will have to look at its four neighbors to see whether their grain heights will lead them to fire. It then determines its own height based on their firing.</p>
<h2 id="Imaging"><a href="#Imaging" class="headerlink" title="Imaging."></a><strong>Imaging.</strong></h2><p><em>Pick two image processing rules and implement them.</em></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Increase or decrease the contrast of an image. Like the negative rule, this does not examine the neighboring pixels. Instead, a cell goes darker in a step when its brightness is below middle grey. It goes lighter in a step when its brightness is above middle grey.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sharpen the image with each step. This is similar to blur, surprisingly. In a blur, a cell takes on a value closer to the average of its neighbors. In a sharpening, a cell takes on a value that differentiates it from the average of its neighbors. This has the global effect of bringing out details, since differences between neighboring pixels get amplified.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Find edges in an image (places where there is a transition from dark to light). Here, in one step, cells should, say, turn white if they are at such a transition. They should turn black if not. Alternatively, they could be bright grey if they are at a major transition, and draker grey if they are at a minor transition.</p>
</li>

<li><p>With the grid in color mode, starting with a pattern where the cells are mostly black, but with white cells forming a boundary of a region and a single cell of a color somewhere in the middle of that region.

</li>
<li><p>In a grid where the cells are mostly black, but with some forming a pattern (or shape) in white. In one step, this rule should make a shadow of the image of white pixels, “underneath” them, in another color, to their SE.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In a grid that is mostly black, except with a blob of pixels that are white somewhere in the middle, have a rule that, after a few steps, ends up drawing a colored rectangle whose width and height is that of the white blob, with that white blob sitting inside.</p>

<h2 id="Programmer’s-choice"><a href="#Programmer’s-choice" class="headerlink" title="Programmer’s choice."></a><strong>Programmer’s choice.</strong></h2><p><em>Devise two more rules.</em></p>
<p>These can be of your own choosing. Ideally, these should be nontrivial and interesting. They could come from the lists above, or be of some other design. Include a clear description of what each does, or at least what you intended each to do.</p>
<h1 id="Making-a-Demo"><a href="#Making-a-Demo" class="headerlink" title="Making a Demo"></a>Making a Demo</h1><p>Having written the eight rules, you must also construct a demonstration of them inside a file named <code>demo.py</code>. To see what this demo code should look like, please examine the provided <code>life.py</code>. Your demo file should be a script that runs each of the eight rules, one by one, to demonstrate each. This coding is similar to the interactions above. After the <code>import</code> section of the code, you’ll make eight different calls to <code>Grid</code>.  This will be something like:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Grid(sandpile,<span class="string">&#x27;1.

<p>These lines each specify their rule of their demo, give a description, and give a starting pattern. On our end, we’ll run your demo to see your work and we’ll use your description to understand what we’re seeing.  Your descriptions can give us instructions for how to set things up and details of what we are about to see. We’ll be running this demo while inspecting your rules’ code.</p>
<p>You can create your own pattern files, similar to our <code>patterns/rpenatmino.pat</code> and other files. If you look at those samples in the <code>patterns</code> folder, you’ll find that they are just text files that can be edited by the same editor you use to edit Python programs. They each start with similar top lines:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">16 16</span><br><span class="line">100</span><br><span class="line">0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 </span><br><span class="line">...</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The first line gives the number of columns (the width of the pattern) and the number of rows (the height of the pattern). The second line gives the range of color values which, in the case of this example, is 0 to 100. The remaining lines give the contents of each row of the pattern. In this case there are 15 rows each with 16 values from 0 to 100.</p>
<p>To help you use richer patterns for your demos, we’ve included a <strong>“Save pattern…”</strong> feature in the simulation. If you hit the <code>s</code> key, click on the console window, and then enter a pattern file name within the console, the simulation will save the currently displayed cell pattern as a text file that can then by loaded by a demo.</p>
<p>The simulation user can also paint cells while <code>Grid</code> runs in demo mode. This allows your demo to instruct the user how to set up the demo by painting. Since the demo doesn’t display the color selection palette, a user can instead type the digits of a cell value, followed by <code>&quot;=&quot;</code>, to choose a particular value for painting.</p>
<p>You can use earlier demo rules to set up a pattern that later rule demos can load. If you include a <code>save_as</code> parameter in an earlier call to <code>Grid</code>, then the cell pattern of the grid will be saved to that file’s name when the user hits <code>&quot;q&quot;</code>. For example, here is a demo that uses a <code>maze</code> rule to set up a maze pattern that can be used as the initial conditions for a subsequent demo of <code>robot</code>.</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Grid(maze,</span><br><span class="line">     <span class="string">&#x27;This builds a maze from a single white square.&#x27;</span>,</span><br><span class="line">     pattern=<span class="string">&#x27;patterns/dot.pat&#x27;</span>,</span><br><span class="line">     save_as=<span class="string">&#x27;patterns/maze.pat&#x27;</span>)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Grid(robot,</span><br><span class="line">     <span class="string">&#x27;Place a robot cell of 40 in the maze.

<p>For image demonstrations, it is okay to just use the two image files provided, for example, <code>images/reed-square.pgm</code>. It is also possible to invent your own images. Ther are in <em>portable grey map</em> or <em>PGM</em> format. This isn’t a very used format— web images are usually <em>JPG</em> or <em>GIF</em> format— but it is an easy format to work with when writing programs. Below gives the start of the square image of Eliot Hall:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">P2</span><br><span class="line">#.</span><br><span class="line">128 128</span><br><span class="line">255</span><br><span class="line"> 17  18  19  20  18 ...</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The first two lines should always be there. The next line gives the dimensions the same as we you need for <code>.pat</code> files. The next line gives the value of pure white. And then the subsequent lines give the value of each pixel.</p>
<p>If you like, you can convert your own images to PGM format.  A program that can do this for you is called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> produced by the <strong>Gnu</strong> free software foundation group.</p>
<h1 id="What-to-Hand-In"><a href="#What-to-Hand-In" class="headerlink" title="What to Hand In"></a>What to Hand In</h1><p>The two files that you will be editing for this project are <code>rules.py</code> and <code>demo.py</code>. Some of you might also have created pattern and image files in the folders <code>patterns</code> and <code>images</code> folders to support your demo.</p>
<p>I’d like you to <strong>submit the entire project folder</strong> as a <em>compressed ZIP file</em> onto Gradescope. To do this, you need to right click on your <code>project1</code> folder. On Windows, you can also click and hold; on the Mac you can hit the <code>[control]</code> key while clicking.  In both systems, this clicking should bring up a menu item that allows you to “compress” your project folder.</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-8d28fa72-f2f9-712f-67df-f80cf89fd4e5">Instructions for compressing on Windows</a>  </li>

</ul>
<p>Having done this, a compressed <code>project1.ZIP</code> file or <code>project1.zip</code> file will get created in the same folder that contains <code>project1</code>.</p>
<p>Upload this ZIP file onto Gradescope. It will unpack into all the files for us to inspect. This will also allow us to download and run your demo.</p>
<p>Each rule’s function definition in <code>rules.py</code> should have a tasteful amount of comments explaining the code that makes up the rule.  You will be graded on these (brief) explanations of your rule’s code and logic. You will be graded on your description of your two programmer’s choice rules. You will also be graded on the quality (the “style”) of your code. The clearer the code, the better.</p>
<p>Your <code>demo.py</code> should contain a runnable demo, with at least one demo (a call of <code>Grid</code>) for each of your eight rules.  Each demo should have a short, readable description displayed during the demo. You should include extra information about what’s being demonstrated within a code comment near the <code>Grid</code> call in <code>demo.py</code>.</p>

<h3 id="Part-1-Search-trees"><a href="#Part-1-Search-trees" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Search trees"></a>Part 1: Search trees</h3><p>For the first two problems below, you are to enhance a class definition of a binary search tree. We’ve provided <a href="BSTree.py"><strong>starting source code</strong></a> for you to download. It contains the definition of a <code>BSTNode</code> class that describes the nodes that make up the structure of a binary search tree. Each such node <code>n</code> has an <code>n.key</code> and an <code>n.value</code>, the two components that serve as an item for a dictionary data structure. It also has two references <code>n.left</code> and <code>n.right</code> that may link to other nodes in the tree or, like a linked list, might have the value <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>The file also contains a definition of a <code>BSTree</code> class that is a binary search tree implementation of an <em>ordered</em> dictionary as described in lecture. A binary search tree object <code>t</code> has a single attribute <code>t.root</code> that refers to the root node of the tree, an object of type <code>BSTnode</code>.  Included in that class are definitions of methods for inserting and updating entries in the dictionary (<code>set_value</code>), looking up dictionary items’ values by their key (<code>get_value</code>), computing the number of entries in the dictionary (<code>size</code>), finding the minimum-valued key (<code>min_key</code>), and gathering all the entries into a list (<code>as_list</code>).  These should be familiar to you as you saw similar code in lecture.</p>
<p>Below we ask you add four methods to the <code>BSTree</code> class. In all our examples illustrating how they are to work, you can assume we’ve typed the following into Python:</p>

<h3 id="Part-2-Sorting"><a href="#Part-2-Sorting" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Sorting"></a>Part 2: Sorting</h3><p>The last two problems ask you to write two classic sorting algorithms, selection sort and count sort. The autograder for each will determine whether the code you submit sorts, but it can’t check whether you’ve used the requested sorting strategy. We will go through and verify that your code is correctly written to our specification to determine your final grade for these two problems.</p>
<p>You can inspect our lecture code for sorting at <a href="sorts.py"><strong>this link</strong></a>.</p>

Like <code>get_value</code>, it should search through the tree looking for that key. It should return a list of strings describing the path taken from the root node to search for that key, a series of <code>&quot;L&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;R&quot;</code>. If the key is in the tree, then the list returned describes where in the tree that key’s node sits.  If the key is not in the tree, then the list returned describes where in the tree that key’s node would be placed were it to be inserted into the tree.</p>

It should modify the value of each node <code>n</code> to instead store <code>f(n.value)</code>.</p>

<p>You might want to look at the <code>size</code> method to see how it works. It uses a recursive helper method that performs the work of touching every node in the tree.</p>
<h2 id="HW11-P3-selection-sort"><a href="#HW11-P3-selection-sort" class="headerlink" title="[HW11 P3] selection sort"></a><code>[HW11 P3]</code> selection sort</h2><p>Selection sort is a method for sorting a list that works by placing the 0-th item, then the 1st item, then the 2nd item, and so on until the list is sorted. It works <em>in place</em>, meaning that it swaps values around (like bubble sort) until the list is sorted. It works by making <em>n-1</em> passes for a list of length <em>n</em>. Let’s number these passes from 0 to <em>n-2</em>.</p>
<p>For the 0-th pass, we scan through the whole list to find the minimum element in the list. We then swap that element with the element at position 0. For the 1st pass, we scan through elements 1 through <em>n-1</em> to find the minimum of those elements. We then swap that element with the element at position 1. We continue in this way. In the <em>i</em>-th pass, we scan through elements <em>i</em> through <em>n-1</em> to find the next minimum value, then perform a swap to place it at position <em>i</em>.</p>
<p>Once we complete the pass numbered <em>n-2</em>, the whole list will be sorted.</p>
<p><strong>Write</strong> a function <code>def selectionSort(someList)</code> that sorts <code>someList</code> it is given using selection sort. Note that your code should not return a sorted list. Instead, it should rearrange the items that are stored in the list it is given.</p>
<h2 id="HW11-P4-count-sort"><a href="#HW11-P4-count-sort" class="headerlink" title="[HW11 P4] count sort"></a><code>[HW11 P4]</code> count sort</h2><p>There are situations in coding where the list of integers that we need to sort are drawn from a limited range. For example, the list</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">[1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0, 1, 0]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>only has elements with values between 0 and 3. When that is the case, it is common to use a special sort called <em>count sort</em>.</p>
<p>Here is how it works. Assume that the numbers in our list are integers from 0 up to <em>m-1</em>. There are two phases. In the first phase we scan through the list and count the number of occurrences of each integer in that list. This is done by making a list of counts <code>count</code>, of length <em>m</em>, where <code>count[i]</code> is the number of times that the value <code>i</code> occurs in the list we are sorting. It makes one pass through the list in order to figure out all these counts.</p>
<p>For the list above, the <code>count</code> list is of length 4 and has the contents</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">[5, 6, 2, 4]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>because 0 appears five times, 1 appears six times, 2 appears twice, and 3 appears four times.</p>
<p>In the second phase, we “rewrite” the list we are sorting to have that data in order. That is, we do the work to place the <em>m</em> values in order into the list according to their counts. For the example list, that ultimately places five 0s, six 1s, two 2s, and four 3s to obtain the list contents</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p><strong>Write</strong> a function <code>def countSort(someList, m)</code> that is given a list and the value of <code>m</code> (indicating that the list values are from 0 to <code>m-1</code>) and sorts the contents of <code>someList</code> using count sort. Note that your code should not return a sorted list. Instead, it should modify the list it is given so that the data is in sorted order.</p>

<p>In the problems below you are asked to develop a series of linked list methods and also classes of objects that use lists of linked nodes as their underlying representation.  You should work from the starting code for linked lists that we showed you in lecture, <a href="LinkedList.py"><em>available for download here.</em></a> In some of the problems, we will ask you to extend the class definition with a new method. In others, we will ask you to devise a class from scratch, but you can use our code to make your methods for that new class.</p>
<p>For these new classes, our testing code will be examining the structure of the linked list of nodes your code makes.  You need to follow our instructions carefully, naming the instance variables the way we prescribe them so that our tests can examine the objects’ underlying linked structure.</p>

<h2 id="HW10-P6-Queue"><a href="#HW10-P6-Queue" class="headerlink" title="[HW10 P6] Queue"></a><code>[HW10 P6]</code> Queue</h2><p>There is a common collection for organizing a sequence of items called a <code>Queue</code>. The two main methods of queues are <code>enqueue</code> which places an item onto the queue, and <code>dequeue</code> which removes an item from the queue.  A <code>dequeue</code> always removes the <em>least recently added</em> item from the queue.</p>
<p>A queue can be thought of as a line of items, where a new item gets added to the back of the line with <code>enqueue</code>, and where <code>dequeue</code> removes the item from the front. The front item is often called the “head” item of the queue.</p>
<p>Create a new <code>Queue</code> class. Write it’s code so that it stores its elements using a linked list.  We’ve <a href="Queue.py"><em>provided a template of the code at this link</em></a> that you can complete by replacing each of the <code>pass</code> lines with a method’s code. In addition to <code>__init__</code>, which makes an empty <code>Queue</code>, it should also have the methods <code>enqueue</code>, <code>dequeue</code>, and <code>head</code>.</p>
<p>Write the code so that it maintains two instance variables <code>first</code> and <code>last</code>.  When the queue is empty, both its <code>self.first</code> and <code>self.last</code> should be <code>None</code>.  When the queue has several items, <code>self.first</code> should contain the node with the value that’s been sitting in the queue the longest. This would be the value that was least recently added, the head item.  The next node after <code>self.first</code> should contain the value that was added after the “head”, and so on, all the way to the node at the end, which should contain the value most recently added.  The variable <code>self.last</code> should be that last node in the list.</p>
<p>When a value is added to the queue with <code>enqueue</code>, a new node should be placed at the end of the list, and <code>self.last</code> should be changed to refer to that new node.  When a value is removed with <code>dequeue</code> the node referenced by <code>self.first</code> should be removed and <code>self.first</code> should change to the next node in the linked list.</p>
<p>The <code>dequeue</code> method should return the value that was held in that removed node. The <code>head</code> method should return the head value, but not remove it from the queue. If the queue is empty, the <code>head</code> method should return <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>When a queue has only one item, <code>self.first</code> and <code>self.last</code> will be referring to the same node in the linked list.</p>

<h2 id="HW10-P7-doubly-linked"><a href="#HW10-P7-doubly-linked" class="headerlink" title="[HW10 P7] doubly-linked"></a><code>[HW10 P7]</code> doubly-linked</h2><p>Let’s now devise a new linked list class with a different node type, one that provides a “doubly-linked” list which we describe below.  We’ll name the new class ‘DLinkedList’ and its node class ‘DLLNode’.</p>
<p>In a doubly-linked list, nodes have a link to both the <em>previous</em> and the next node in their structure.  That means that each ‘DLLNode’ should have a <code>value</code>, a <code>next</code>, and a <code>prev</code>. The use of <code>value</code> and <code>next</code> are as before for singly-linked lists. As before, a node’s <code>next</code> refers to the node that follows it in the linked structure. In addition, a node’s <code>prev</code> refers to the node that <em>precedes it</em> in the linked structure. When a node is the last in the linked list, its <code>next</code> should be <code>None</code>. If a node is the first in the linked list, its <code>prev</code> should be <code>None</code>.  For any node that is neither the first or the last, its <code>next</code> node should have it as <code>prev</code>. Its <code>prev</code> node should have it as <code>next</code>. That is to say, for any node <code>n</code> sitting somewhere in the middle of a doubly-linked list</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">n.<span class="built_in">next</span>.prev == n</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">n.prev.<span class="built_in">next</span> == n</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Rewrite the code for the <em>original</em> <code>LinkedList.py</code> source we provided.  Call it <code>DLinkedList.py</code> and name its classes <code>DLLNode</code> and <code>DLinkedList</code>.  Its <code>DLLNode</code> class should build doubly-linked nodes that contain both <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> attributes. A <code>DLinkedList</code> object should have two attributes: <code>first</code> and <code>last</code>. When the list is empty, these should both be set to <code>None</code>. When the list has length one, that one node should be both the <code>first</code> and the <code>last</code>. When the list is longer, <code>first</code> should refer to that list’s first node and <code>last</code> should refer to that list’s last node.</p>
<p>Write the <code>append</code>, <code>insert</code>, and <code>delete</code> methods of <code>DLinkedList</code> so that they modify both <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> when nodes are linked and unlinked with these methods. They should also modify the <code>first</code> and <code>last</code> references in cases where those parts of the list structure change.</p>
<p>Note that the other methods we wrote for <code>LinkedList</code> will not need to be changed for <code>DLinkedList</code>. They will still work since they only inspect the nodes in the list (they don’t modify them) and rely only on the <code>next</code> attribute of nodes and the <code>first</code> attribute of lists.</p>

<p>Here we exercise the <em>higher order</em> function aspects of Python. The Python language allows you to treat functions as data. You can pass function objects as parameters to functions and you can return functions from functions.  Functions can also be described tersely, and <em>anonymously</em>, with the <code>lambda</code> construct.</p>
<p>We focus briefly on the trickiest of these features: functions that return functions. Consider the kind of Python code suggested below</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">def functionMaker(...):</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    def some_function(...):</span><br><span class="line">        ...</span><br><span class="line">        # code of some_function</span><br><span class="line">        ...</span><br><span class="line">        return ...</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    return some_function</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The function <code>functionMaker</code> is handed some information. Using that information it describes <code>some_function</code> and returns that function object to the code that called <code>functionMaker</code>.  Here is a more realized version of that code:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">makeAdder</span>(<span class="params">amount</span>):</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">add</span>(<span class="params">x</span>):</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> x + amount</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> add</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The function <code>makeAdder</code> returns back a function that adds a specific <code>amount</code> to its parameter <code>x</code>.  So <code>makeAdder(1)</code> returns an incrementing function, and <code>makeAdder(10)</code> returns an “adds 10” function.</p>
<p>We could also write the <code>makeAdder</code> function like below:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">makeAdder</span>(<span class="params">amount</span>):</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    add = (<span class="keyword">lambda</span> x: x+amount)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> add</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>or simply</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">makeAdder</span>(<span class="params">amount</span>):</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> (<span class="keyword">lambda</span> x: x+amount)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>This somehow makes it clear what’s happening: <code>makeAdder</code> gives back a function object that uses any specific <code>amount</code> you feed <code>makeAdder</code> as input. The code below builds three different function objects, one for each amount:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; adds10 = makeAdder(10)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; adds1 = makeAdder(1)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; adds37 = makeAdder(37)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; adds10(8)</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; adds1(8)</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; adds37(8)</span><br><span class="line">45</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>You can write <code>makeAdder</code> more tersely as:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">makeAdder = (<span class="keyword">lambda</span> amount: (<span class="keyword">lambda</span> x: x + amount))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>This is just a nested pair of <code>lambda</code> expressions.</p>

<p>The function <code>max_of_two</code> is a higher-order function because it takes two function parameters.</p>

The first is an integer function and the next two are integers. It should return the average value of function <code>f</code> when evaluated on numbers in the range from <code>start</code> up to <code>end</code>.

<p>The function <code>average</code> is a higher-order function because it takes a function as a parameter.</p>
<p>You can assume that <code>start</code> is not larger than <code>end</code> and so there is at least one value in the range.</p>
<h2 id="HW9-P3-brick-maker"><a href="#HW9-P3-brick-maker" class="headerlink" title="[HW9 P3] brick maker"></a><code>[HW9 P3]</code> brick maker</h2><p>Define a function <code>brick_maker</code> that takes a single parameter— a symbol represented as a string—and returns a function that’s specialized for making a rectangular “brick” , that is, a string made up of repeats of that character, of a given width and height.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; at_brick = brick_maker(&#x27;@&#x27;)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; dot_brick = brick_maker(&#x27;.&#x27;)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; print(at_brick(3,2))</span><br><span class="line">@@@</span><br><span class="line">@@@</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; print(dot_brick(5,1))</span><br><span class="line">.....</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; print(dot_brick(3,4))</span><br><span class="line">...</span><br><span class="line">...</span><br><span class="line">...</span><br><span class="line">...</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; at_brick(2,2)</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;@@\n@@\n&#x27;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Note that the function given back by <code>brick_maker</code> is <em>a function that</em> <strong>returns</strong> <em>a string</em>. Neither <code>at_brick</code> nor <code>dot_brick</code> print. In our first few tests, above, we explicitly <code>print</code> the string returned by <code>at_brick</code> and <code>dot_brick</code>. In the last test, we examine the string returned by <code>at_brick</code>.</p>
<p>Bricks have positive widths and positive heights. You need not worry about handling brick parameters that are not positive.</p>
<p>The function <code>brick_maker</code> is higher order.  When given a symbol it gives back a function, one that happens to be a brick creation function for that symbol.</p>

It should return function <code>h</code>, with the property that when given a value <code>x</code> the result of <code>h(x)</code> should be the maximum of <code>f(x)</code> and <code>g(x)</code>.  Note that this function is very different from the function <code>max_of_two</code>, but the two are closely related.</p>

<p>The <code>max_of_funcs</code> is a higher-order function because it takes two function parameters and returns a function.</p>
<h2 id="HW9-P5-conditional-print"><a href="#HW9-P5-conditional-print" class="headerlink" title="[HW9 P5] conditional print"></a><code>[HW9 P5]</code> conditional print</h2><p>Write a function <code>conditional_print</code>. It is a higher-order function that takes a parameter and gives back a <em>printing procedure</em>, one that acts like the built-in <code>print</code> procedure by outputting information to the terminal. This printing function will behave a little differently though: the function that <code>conditional_print</code> gives back will be a <em>conditionally printing procedure</em>.</p>
<p>Let’s pin down what we mean by this. The <code>print</code> procedure takes a parameter and always prints it, like so:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; print(6)</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; print(3)</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; print(7)</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; print(37)</span><br><span class="line">37</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; print(36)</span><br><span class="line">36</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>A “conditionally printing procedure” only prints inputs of a particular type (while doing nothing on other inputs).  For example, you could create a function that prints its integer input when it is a multiple of 3, and does nothing otherwise.  Suppose you did this, defined a function called <code>print_when_mult_of_three</code>, and used it instead of <code>print</code>.  Then, we’d expect to see this kind of interaction:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; print_when_mult_of_three(6)</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; print_when_mult_of_three(3)</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; print_when_mult_of_three(7)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; print_when_mult_of_three(37)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; print_when_mult_of_three(36)</span><br><span class="line">36</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You’ll notice what happened there. When the function was fed multiples of three (like 6, 3, and 36) it printed those. For the other numbers, it didn’t do anything. It printed only when that condition was met.</p>
<p>So, back to the matter at hand: we want you to write a higher-order function called <code>conditional_print</code> that constructs conditionally printing procedures. It should take a single input, which we will call a “test”.  A test is a function that only returns <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.  When given a test, <code>conditional_print</code> should return a conditionally printing procedure that only prints when the test returns <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>It can then be used like below</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; mult_of_three = (lambda n: n % 3 == 0)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; pr_mo3 = conditional_print(mult_of_three)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; pr_mo3(6)</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; pr_mo3(7)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; pr_pos =  conditional_print(lambda x: x &gt; 0)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; pr_pos(7)</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; pr_pos(-7)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; pr_pos(0)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; pr_pos(1)</span><br><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The <code>conditional_print</code> function is higher-order because it takes a function as a parameter. It also returns back a function, a procedure that conditionally prints.</p>

<p>This lab has you work with Python’s object-oriented facilities. We look at defining Python object classes, a means for inventing new data types that your programs can use. In doing so, we describe the components that make up the object and also the operations that can be performed on that object. The components are an object’s <em>instance variables</em> and the operations’ code defines an object’s <em>methods</em>. Typical methods access (or “get”) the information stored in an object’s components. Other methods might also modify them.</p>
<p>Below we talk through the design of two object classes described in lecture. These are a <code>class Rational</code> and a <code>class GiftCard</code>. After describing these two classes, we then talk about inheritance.  This <a href="homework8code.zip"><strong>zip file</strong></a> has the Python source code for the examples in these descriptions.</p>
<h2 id="A-Rational-class"><a href="#A-Rational-class" class="headerlink" title="A Rational class"></a>A <code>Rational</code> class</h2><p>We first invented a data structure for representing rational numbers. A rational number was represented by its numerator and its denominator. You can multiply them and sum them. We also described “getters” for accessing its fraction’s two components and a method converting it to a printable string.</p>
<p>If you check out the file <code>Rational.py</code> you will see the implementation of a Python class for a new type <code>Rational</code>.  In the interaction below, we can see import and use of this class:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; from Rational import Rational</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Rational(1, -3)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; a.stringOf()</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;-1/3&#x27;</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Rational(3, 6)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; b.stringOf()</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;1/2&#x27;</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; c = a.sumWith(b)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; c.output()</span><br><span class="line">1/6</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The first line loads the definition of the <code>Rational</code> class into Python. The second and fourth lines each explicitly construct a <code>Rational</code> object. The behavior of the constructor is given by the lines at the start of <code>Rational.py</code>, namely</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title class_">Rational</span>:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">__init__</span>(<span class="params">self,n,d</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># Normalize it so the sign is up top.</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> d &lt; <span class="number">0</span>:</span><br><span class="line">        n *= -<span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">        d *= -<span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># Reduce the fraction.</span></span><br><span class="line">    g = GCD(n,d)</span><br><span class="line">    self.num = n // g</span><br><span class="line">    self.den = d // g</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Here we see the main goal of a class constructor’s initialization method <code>__init__</code>. It sets the two attributes of a rational number object, named <code>num</code> and <code>den</code>. This is performed in the last two lines of the definition:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">self.num = n // g</span><br><span class="line">self.den = d // g</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Within that code, <code>self.num</code> is how we add a new attribute to a newly created object. <code>self</code> is assumed to be that object.</p>
<p>The code takes two integer values, and divides out their common divisor. It makes sure that, if the fraction is negative, that the numerator holds the negative value.</p>
<p>Since the constructor takes two parameters, the definition of the <code>__init__</code> method takes three parameters. This is because every method has to take the receiving object, denoted <code>self</code>, as its first argument, like so:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">__init__</span>(<span class="params">self, n, d</span>):</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The lines below take the two parameters <code>n</code> and <code>d</code>, work with them to set up the components of <code>self</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>__init__</code> method is typically not called directly. Rather, it is the code that’s run when we construct a new <code>Rational</code> with an expression like:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Rational(<span class="number">36</span>,<span class="number">24</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Other methods are defined similarly. The method that requests that a <code>Rational</code> number be added to another, and that that third number be returned, is given below:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">sumWith</span>(<span class="params">self, other</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    ns = self.numerator()</span><br><span class="line">    ds = self.denominator()</span><br><span class="line">    no = other.numerator()</span><br><span class="line">    do = other.denominator()</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> Rational(ns*do + no*ds, ds*do)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The first four lines get the four integer components of the two objects, the receiving object <code>self</code> and the parameter <code>other</code>. This code gets used when we write something like</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">c = a.sumWith(b)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>In this case. <code>a</code> will be what <code>self</code> refers to when the method’s code runs, and <code>b</code> will be <code>other</code>. The last line of the method returns a new rational number by calling the constructor. <code>c</code> will get set to refer to that new object.</p>
<p>Note that <code>Rational</code> number objects aren’t designed to be <em>mutable</em>.</p>
<h2 id="A-GiftCard-class"><a href="#A-GiftCard-class" class="headerlink" title="A GiftCard class"></a>A <code>GiftCard</code> class</h2><p>Another example we showed was a class that represented a card with a balance. You can see its definition in the file <code>GiftCard.py</code>. These lines below work with an <code>GiftCard</code> object after importing the <code>GiftCard</code> code:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="keyword">from</span> GiftCard <span class="keyword">import</span> GiftCard</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>gc = GiftCard(<span class="number">100</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>gc.spend(<span class="number">20</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">80</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>gc.addFunds(<span class="number">10</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">90</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The <code>GiftCard</code> is a simple example of a mutable object. It stores an amount <code>balance</code> that can be increased by <code>addFunds</code> and decreased by <code>spend</code>. Here is further interaction</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>gc.spend(<span class="number">55</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">35</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>gc.spend(<span class="number">50</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">&#x27;Insufficient funds&#x27;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>gc.getBalance()</span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">35</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The spend method is written like so:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">spend</span>(<span class="params">self, amount</span>): </span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> amount &gt; self.balance:</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="string">&quot;Insufficient funds&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">    self.balance = self.balance - amount</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> self.balance</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Here, again, we see two parameters for a one-parameter method. There is the receiver <code>self</code> and then also the <code>amount</code> that should be withdrawn from the card’s balance. The line</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">self.balance = self.balance - amount</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>modifies the card’s balance, and this only occurs if <code>amount &lt;= self.balance</code>. If instead <code>amount &gt; self.balance</code> then the method returns an error string.</p>
<p>Take a look at the rest of its method definitions, including its <code>__init__</code> method</p>
<h2 id="Inheritance"><a href="#Inheritance" class="headerlink" title="Inheritance"></a>Inheritance</h2><p>In object-oriented languages, we can construct hierarchies of object classes. In lecture we did this with bank account classes <code>Account</code>, <code>Checking</code>, and <code>Savings</code>, the latter two being <em>subclasses</em> of the former. A subclass inherits the methods of their designated superclass, but then might override some of its behavior and perhaps have additional methods. This can be seen as a <em>specialization</em> of their superclass.</p>
<p>Designation of which superclass gets extended by a newly defined subclass is simple code syntax. Suppose we have a class <code>A</code> and want to invent a class <code>B</code> that inherits from <code>A</code>. We then write</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">class B(A):</span><br><span class="line">    ...</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>putting the superclass <code>A</code> in parentheses. This tells Python that all the class attributes and instance methods of <code>A</code> should also be defined for <code>B</code>.  And then, under <code>...</code> we usually introduce other class attributes and some other of its instances’ methods. We might also override methods that we’re inherited.</p>
<p>To see a short, but rich-enough example, review the <code>Account.py</code> code.  In that code, there are moments when we are overriding a method, where we choose to modify the behavior of the subclass relative to its superclass, and we explicitly need to call the method code of the superclass. We do this for <code>Saving</code>‘s <code>withdraw</code> method by calling</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">`Account.withdraw(self,...)`</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>This is a slightly different syntax than normal method invocation.  The <code>self</code> parameter is included in the parentheses, and this is because we are using the <code>Account...</code> notation to indicate that we want to run the method defined for class <code>Account</code>.  We do this also for <code>Checking.payInterest</code> and also <code>PromotionalChecking.__init__</code>.</p>
<h1 id="Problems"><a href="#Problems" class="headerlink" title="Problems"></a>Problems</h1><h2 id="HW8-P1-Dial"><a href="#HW8-P1-Dial" class="headerlink" title="[HW8 P1] Dial"></a><code>[HW8 P1]</code> Dial</h2><p>A <code>Dial</code> is an object that can be controlled to be set to a certain level, and that level can be displayed. It has an upper limit on its level that can be configured. Its lower limit is 0. Below we see the construction and use of a <code>Dial</code> object whose limit is <code>10</code>.</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>d = Dial(<span class="number">10</span>,<span class="string">&#x27;O&#x27;</span>,<span class="string">&#x27;.&#x27;</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>d.display()</span><br><span class="line">[..........]</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>d.increaseBy(<span class="number">7</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>d.display()</span><br><span class="line">[OOOOOOO...]</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>d.decreaseBy(<span class="number">2</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>d.display()</span><br><span class="line">[OOOOO.....]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>When first constructed, its initial level is <code>0</code>. But then that level can be increased with <code>increaseBy</code>. It can also be decreased using <code>decreaseBy</code>. To configure its display, you build a dial object by feeding its constructor two characters. The first is used to display a unit of the dial’s current level, and the other is for the remaining characters.</p>
<p>Here is the behavior of a different dial</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>d = Dial(<span class="number">7</span>,<span class="string">&#x27;#&#x27;</span>,<span class="string">&#x27;-&#x27;</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>d.increaseBy(<span class="number">3</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>d.display()</span><br><span class="line">[<span class="comment">###----]</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>d.increaseBy(<span class="number">10</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>d.display()</span><br><span class="line">[<span class="comment">#######]</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>d.decreaseBy(<span class="number">1</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>d.display()</span><br><span class="line">[<span class="comment">######-]</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>d.decreaseBy(<span class="number">17</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>d.display()</span><br><span class="line">[-------]</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>d.increaseBy(<span class="number">1</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>d.display()</span><br><span class="line">[<span class="comment">#------]</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The method <code>increaseBy</code> takes an integer (assumed to be positive) and increased by that amount. If the increase would take the dial over its limit, the level gets set to the limit. The same goes for <code>decreaseBy</code>. It takes a positive integer and lowers the level by that amount, but only if that decrease wouldn’t set the level negative. If it would, the level gets set to 0.</p>
<p>In a file named <code>Dial.py</code>, write the code for a class definition that defines <code>class Dial</code> and its methods. In addition to <code>__init__</code> you should define <code>increaseBy</code>, <code>decreaseBy</code>, and <code>display</code>.</p>
<p>The method <code>display</code> prints the characters of the display showing the current level. It should work as our examples illustrate.  The method does not return the display string. Instead, it prints it out to the console.</p>
<p>To test your code, you’ll want to run Python with no arguments like so:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">% python3</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="keyword">from</span> Dial <span class="keyword">import</span> Dial</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The first thing you’ll want to enter is the <code>import</code> line. This will load in the definition of <code>Dial</code>.</p>
<h2 id="HW8-P2-Car"><a href="#HW8-P2-Car" class="headerlink" title="[HW8 P2] Car"></a><code>[HW8 P2]</code> Car</h2><p>The next class we build is called <code>Car</code>. Make a new file called <code>Car.py</code> and write its class definition. It represents automobiles driving around some area. We will assume for this assignment that our world is a flat plane with no obstacles, meaning all trips take the straight-line path between the start and end points.  There is a car factory where cars are built and introduced into the world.</p>
<p>We identify where cars are located by a pair of coordinates— a <em>y</em>-coordinate describing how many miles to the north or south a car sits from their origin and an <em>x</em>-coordinate describing how many miles to the east or west that a cars sits from their origin. So a car sitting at <code>[1.0,0.0]</code> is one mile east of the factory.  A car sitting at <code>[0.0,-1.0]</code> is one mile south of the factory. A car sitting at <code>[-1.414, 1.414]</code> is about two miles northwest of the factory.</p>
<p>The <code>Car</code> constructor should set up the basic starting values of things we might care about for a given instance of the class. For this assignment, that should be the miles per gallon that the car gets and the size of the car’s gas tank.</p>
<p>Please have your <code>Car</code> constructor function <code>__init__</code> take these two additional values as parameters in that order: miles per gallon, then fuel tank capacity.  The constructor should initialize instance variables to carry these values, along with the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> position where the car sits (initially at the origin), along with how much fuel is in the tank (initially, make it a full tank).</p>
<p>Now, add a <code>Car</code> method <code>driveTo</code>. It should take two additional parameters, namely, the x and y coordinates of a location for the car to attempt to move. If the car has enough gas to make the trip, the car should be moved, the amount of gas remaining should be updated, and the method should return <code>True</code>. If the car does not have enough gas, it should not be moved or changed at all, and the method should return <code>False</code>.</p>
<p>To perform this check of the gas, you’ll need to figure out the distance that a car would travel. This distance is</p>
<p>$$<br>\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}<br>$$<br>were the car to move from a location<br>$[x_1,y_1]$ to a location<br>$[x_2,y_2]$.</p>
<p>So that we can test your class, we need you to add some additional methods that allow us to find out information about the car.  Add two methods named <code>getLocationX</code> and <code>getLocationY</code> These in tandem return the current location of the car, by returning its <em>x</em> coordinate and its <em>y</em> coordinate.  Also add a <code>getGas</code> method which returns the number of gallons of gas the car has left.  Finally, add a <code>getToFill</code> method which returns how much gas the car would need to fill its tank back to capacity.</p>
<p>Though these methods are used for our testing, it is normal to add these “getter” methods that access the contents of an object’s instance variables, rather than having them accessed directly.  This provides a reasonable “layer of abstraction”, allowing you to change the internals of this class without having to change all the code that relies on this class.</p>
<p>You can test this code by creating a car and driving it around.  Again, you will want to import the definition using the Python <code>import</code> statement like so:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="keyword">from</span> Car <span class="keyword">import</span> Car</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h2 id="HW8-P3-VerboseDial"><a href="#HW8-P3-VerboseDial" class="headerlink" title="[HW8 P3] VerboseDial"></a><code>[HW8 P3]</code> VerboseDial</h2><p>Let’s work from your <code>Dial.py</code> code. Make a copy of your <code>Dial.py</code> as a file named <code>VerboseDial.py</code>. In that file add a new class definition below <code>Dial</code> named <code>VerboseDial</code> that is a subclass of <code>Dial</code>.  This object is just like <code>Dial</code> except that it always outputs the display of the dial after its level has been increased or decreased. Here is an example interaction:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>vbd = VerboseDial(<span class="number">10</span>,<span class="string">&#x27;O&#x27;</span>,<span class="string">&#x27;.&#x27;</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>vbd.display()</span><br><span class="line">[..........]    </span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>vbd.increaseBy(<span class="number">7</span>)</span><br><span class="line">[OOOOOOO...]</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>vbd.decreaseBy(<span class="number">2</span>)</span><br><span class="line">[OOOOO.....]</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>vbd.decreaseBy(<span class="number">5</span>)</span><br><span class="line">[..........]</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>vbd.decreaseBy(<span class="number">2</span>)</span><br><span class="line">[..........]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Note that each call to <code>increaseBy</code> and <code>decreaseBy</code> leads to a <code>print</code> of the dial’s display. This happens even if the dial’s level doesn’t actually change.  In the last decrease, the level stayed at 0, but the verbose version of the dial displays after each call of <code>increaseBy</code> and <code>decreaseBy</code>, regardless.</p>
<h2 id="HW8-P4-OnOffDial"><a href="#HW8-P4-OnOffDial" class="headerlink" title="[HW8 P4] OnOffDial"></a><code>[HW8 P4]</code> OnOffDial</h2><p>Now we invent a subclass of <code>VerboseDial</code> named <code>OnOffDial</code>.  Make a copy of <code>Verbose.py</code> as a file <code>OnOffDial.py</code>.  You will add a third class definition to this file.</p>
<p>An on&#x2F;off dial’s verbose behavior can be turned on or off. When first built it behaves the same as a <code>VerboseDial</code> like below:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>ood = OnOffDial(<span class="number">10</span>,<span class="string">&#x27;O&#x27;</span>,<span class="string">&#x27;.&#x27;</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>ood.display()</span><br><span class="line">[..........]    </span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>ood.increaseBy(<span class="number">7</span>)</span><br><span class="line">[OOOOOOO...]</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>ood.decreaseBy(<span class="number">2</span>)</span><br><span class="line">[OOOOO.....]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>It has two additional methods <code>turnOff</code> and <code>turnOn</code>.  These methods take no parameters other than <code>self</code> and so are passed no arguments. They behave like so, continuing from the interaction above:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>ood.turnOff()</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>ood.display()</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>ood.increaseBy(<span class="number">4</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>ood.decreaseBy(<span class="number">1</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>ood.turnOn()</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>ood.display()</span><br><span class="line">[OOOOOOOO..]</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>ood.decreaseBy(<span class="number">3</span>)</span><br><span class="line">[OOOOO.....]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>When an <code>OnOffDial</code> is turned off, it never displays, not even when the <code>display</code> method is called. But then it can be turned back on.  When on, it behaves like a <code>VerboseDisplay</code> unless and until it is turned off again.</p>
<h2 id="HW8-P5-Taxi"><a href="#HW8-P5-Taxi" class="headerlink" title="[HW8 P5] Taxi"></a><code>[HW8 P5]</code> Taxi</h2><p>Let’s build another kind of car for simulating a taxi.  We create a <code>Taxi</code> class that inherits from <code>Car</code>. Taxis have the additional behavior that they can pick up passengers and drop them off. Also, a taxi’s driver earns money as a result of a trip taken with a passenger. When a taxi is first created, its driver has no money.</p>
<p>To do this coding, make a copy of <code>Car.py</code> called <code>Taxi.py</code>.  Here you’ll add your definition of the <code>Taxi</code> class.</p>
<p>Add <code>pickup</code> and <code>dropoff</code> methods to taxis. The <code>pickup</code> method changes the status of the taxi so that it is holding a passenger (it does not change any other aspect of the taxi). At that point, the taxi should track the miles it drives while carrying a passenger.  The <code>dropoff</code> method drops off a passenger.  When that happens, the taxi gets paid at $2 for the pickup plus $3 per mile driven with the passenger. The method should also change the status of the taxi to indicate that it is no longer holding a passenger.</p>
<p>In addition, the <code>pickup</code> and <code>dropoff</code> methods should return <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> to signify if the method executed successfully.  In particular, <code>False</code> should be returned if <code>pickup</code> is run on a taxi that already has a passenger. <code>False</code> should be returned by <code>dropoff</code> if is run on a taxi that has no passenger.</p>
<p>Also add a getter method <code>getMoney</code> that reports the amount of money that the taxi has earned by transporting its passenger.</p>

<p>This week you are to write several functions that <em>call themselves</em> to do their own work, that is, for each exercise you are asked to write a <em>recursive function</em>.  A classic example of this is the factorial function, which computes<br>$$<br>    n! &#x3D; n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \cdots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1<br>$$</p>
<p>This can be viewed as a recursive calculation because the product just above can be written as a product of the number <code>n</code> muliplied by the prior factorial, like so:</p>
<p>$$<br>\begin{array}{rcl}<br>n! &amp; &#x3D; &amp; n \times ((n-1) \times (n-2) \times \cdots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1) \<br>   &amp; &#x3D; &amp; n \times ((n-1)!)<br>\end{array}<br>$$<br>And so we can write factorial this way:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">fact</span>(<span class="params">n</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> n &gt; <span class="number">1</span>:</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> n * factorial(n-<span class="number">1</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">else</span>:</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="number">1</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The <em>recursive case</em> when <code>n</code> is larger than 1 (and so the product has several terms) is just the Python form of the expression <code>n * ((n-1)!)</code>, The <em>base case</em> occurs when the product is just a single term (when <code>n == 1</code>). This case is handled by the <code>else</code> within this function.</p>
<p>For all of these below, you’ll want to figure out a similar pattern in their calculation.  Ask yourself: how can the actvity of the function be structured so as to rely on itself? You’ll also want to ask: how do I handle the simple case(s)? These recursive functions rely on the simplest base cases so that this kind of unwinding terminates.</p>
<p>As we saw in class, if you forget the base case then you’ll probably get an error that your code’s execution exceeded Python’s maximum recursion depth.</p>
<p>You should not be using any loops to solve these problems.  Use recursion!</p>
<h1 id="Problems"><a href="#Problems" class="headerlink" title="Problems"></a>Problems</h1><h2 id="HW7-P1-print-digits"><a href="#HW7-P1-print-digits" class="headerlink" title="[HW7 P1] print digits"></a><code>[HW7 P1]</code> print digits</h2><p>Write a printing procedure <code>def print_digits(n)</code> that, when given a positive integer <code>n</code>, outputs the sequence of its digits, one digit on each line. It should output the digits in order of least significant to most significant. This means that the ones digit should be first, followed by the tens digit, followed by the hundreds digit, and so on.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; print_digits(1234)</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; print_digits(3731)</span><br><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; print_digits(7)</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Your procedure must be recursive. It should call itself somewhere within its own definition.</p>
<p>A quick hint: note that we can think of this procedure, for numbers 10 or larger, as printing the ones digit, followed by printing the other digits.  So for the second example. We output 1, and then we output the digits of 373.</p>
<p>Notice that you only need to worry about printing the digits of positive integers. We don’t expect your code to work correctly for 0 or for negative numbers.</p>
<p>You should not get the digits of an integer by converting it to a string with <code>str</code>. Use the integer division operations <code>//</code> and <code>%</code> instead.</p>
<h2 id="HW7-P2-remainder"><a href="#HW7-P2-remainder" class="headerlink" title="[HW7 P2] remainder"></a><code>[HW7 P2]</code> remainder</h2><p>Consider the quotient and remainder operations when a non-negative integer is divided by a positive integer.  For example, 37 divided by 10 is 3 with a remainder of 7.  One way of thinking about the remainder is that it is the amount left over after repeatedly taking away the divisor from that number. So, since 7 is the result of subtracting 10 three times from 37, is the remainder due to that division by 10. 7 &#x3D; 37-10-10-10.</p>
<p>Looking at this process, we can see that 37, 27, 17, and 7 all have the same remainder when divided by 10.</p>
<p>Write a <em>recursive</em> function <code>def remainder(n,d)</code> that, for any non-negative integer <code>n</code> and positive integer <code>d</code>, computes<br>the remainder <code>n % d</code> and returns it.  </p>

<p>This week’s lab exercises are a mix of problems that have you work with Python lists and with Python dictionaries. We ask you to write a function for each of them.</p>
<p>Let me just remind you that lists and dictionaries are both <em>passed by reference</em> to a function.  This means that it is possible to change the values stored in them, and to increase and decrease their size by applying certain operations to them, within a function’s code. These changes can be noticed by the client code that uses the function that changes them.</p>
<p>An example of this comes from lecture. We wrote the code for <code>rotate_right</code> as below</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">rotate_right</span>(<span class="params">xs</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="built_in">len</span>(xs) &gt; <span class="number">1</span>:</span><br><span class="line">        last = xs.pop()</span><br><span class="line">        xs.insert(<span class="number">0</span>,last)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The function does not return anything, but it takes the list <code>xs</code> and modifies it by performing a <code>pop</code> to remove the last value in the list, followed by an <code>insert</code> that puts that value at the front. Here it is in action:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; some_values = [11, 7, 17, -3, 5]</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; rotate_right(some_values)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; some_values</span><br><span class="line">[5, 11, 7, 17, -3]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Calling the function with a list has the effect of “rotating” the contents of the list it is passed.</p>
<p>Because of this ability to modify lists and dictionaries, you need to pay careful attention as to whether we want your function to change the data structure it is given, and also whether or not we want you to build and return a new data structure.</p>
<h1 id="Problems"><a href="#Problems" class="headerlink" title="Problems"></a>Problems</h1><h2 id="HW6-P1-make-even"><a href="#HW6-P1-make-even" class="headerlink" title="[HW6 P1] make even"></a><code>[HW6 P1]</code> make even</h2><p>Write a function <code>def make_even(xs)</code> that, when given a list of integers <code>xs</code>, modifies the elements of the list to make them all divisible by 2. If a list element is even, it should not be changed. If a list element is odd, it should be decremented by one. The <code>make_even</code> function should modify the list it is given, and not return a list back.  Have it return the value <code>None</code>, and have the list be modified as a <em>side effect</em> of being executed.  Here is an example of its behavior:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; ys = [1, 3, 2, -7, 0, -8, 11]</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; zs = [10, 0, 1, 1, -1, 100]</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; make_even(ys)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; make_even(zs)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; ys</span><br><span class="line">[0, 2, 2, -8, 0, -8, 10]</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; zs</span><br><span class="line">[10, 0, 0, 0, -2, 100]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h2 id="HW6-P2-remove-duplicates"><a href="#HW6-P2-remove-duplicates" class="headerlink" title="[HW6 P2] remove duplicates"></a><code>[HW6 P2]</code> remove duplicates</h2><p>Write a function <code>def remove_duplicates(xs)</code> that takes a list of integers and modifies it so that it has the same set of integer items, but with no items duplicated. For example: ~~~ none &gt;&gt;&gt; zs1 &#x3D; [100, 0, 1, -1, 1, 100] &gt;&gt;&gt; remove_duplicates(zs1) &gt;&gt;&gt; zs1 [100, 0, 1, -1] &gt;&gt;&gt; zs2 &#x3D; [100, 100, 100, 100] &gt;&gt;&gt; remove_duplicates(zs2) &gt;&gt;&gt; zs2 [100] &gt;&gt;&gt; zs3 &#x3D; [] &gt;&gt;&gt; remove_duplicates(zs3) &gt;&gt;&gt; zs3 [] ~~~ The list that results should have the same ordering as the ordering of the first occurrences of each integer as they appeared before the duplicates were removed.</p>
<h2 id="HW6-P3-diagonal-table"><a href="#HW6-P3-diagonal-table" class="headerlink" title="[HW6 P3] diagonal table"></a><code>[HW6 P3]</code> diagonal table</h2><p>Below is a list of lists, where each list has the same length:</p>

<p>The “outer” list has three elememts in it, and each such element is a four-element list. If that list is called <code>table</code>, then accessing the list slot with the value 7 can be done with the notation</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">table[2][1]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>because it is held in the last of the three lists, and it is item 1 of that last list.</p>
<p>We can think of a lists of lists as a table.  Below I’ve laid out its contents to suggest its tabular form:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">[[1, 2, 0, 1],</span><br><span class="line"> [5, 3, 1, 4],</span><br><span class="line"> [8, 7, 1, 5]]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>It has three rows and four columns.  We see that 7 is in row number 2 (the top row is row 0), and in column 1 (the left column is column 0). In general, we can access the item in row <code>r</code> and column <code>c</code> with the notation</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">table[r][c]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Write a function <code>def diagonal_table(size)</code> that, when given a positive integer <code>size</code>, returns a list of lists that is a table with the same number of rows and columns in it, with each dimension of length <code>size</code>. It should be full of 0s, excepting that all the entries along the table’s diagonal have the value 1. For example</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; t = diagonal_table(4)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; t</span><br><span class="line">[[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Laying the result out as a table, we get</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">[[1, 0, 0, 0],</span><br><span class="line"> [0, 1, 0, 0],</span><br><span class="line"> [0, 0, 1, 0],</span><br><span class="line"> [0, 0, 0, 1]]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Note that all the non-zero entries are <code>t[i][i]</code>, all the locations where the row number <code>i</code> is the same as the column number <code>i</code>.</p>

<p>Write a function <code>def word_count(s)</code> that takes a string <code>s</code> and gives back a dictionary that gives an integer count of the number of times each word appears in <code>s</code>. There should be a dictionary entry for every word that appears in <code>s</code> and each should have a value of 1 or more that corresponds to the number of times that word appears.</p>

<p>You can assume that the string consists of only the letters from <code>&#39;a&#39;</code> to <code>&#39;z&#39;</code> and spaces, that there are no spaces at the front or end of the string, and that there are never two consecutive spaces.</p>
<p>Note that the ordering of dictionary entries produced by Python’s report does not matter. Dictionary entries, unlike list entires, are unordered. This means that</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; word_count(&quot;hello there&quot;)</span><br><span class="line">&#123;&#x27;there&#x27;:1, &#x27;hello&#x27;:1&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Write a function <code>def replace_using(s,d)</code> that takes a string <code>s</code> that is a space-separated string of words like in problem <code>[HW6 P4]</code>. It also takes a dictionary of word substitutions. It returns the string that results from applying the replacements in <code>d</code> to the string <code>s</code>.</p>

<p>Notice that the replacement occurs as a result of one pass through the string.  In the second example, we replaced each <code>&#39;i&#39;</code> in the original string with <code>&#39;as&#39;</code> and we replaced each <code>&#39;as&#39;</code> in the original string with <code>&#39;yass&#39;</code>.

<p>This week we again ask you to write a function for each of the homework exercises.  For some of these you might sometimes find it useful to write other “helper” functions. These can be used by the primary function you are asked to write.  It’s not necessary to do this, but it can sometimes make your problem-solving and your testing easier.</p>
<p>All the required functions act on Pytgon lists, a <em>mutable, reference-based</em> data structure for storing collections of values. Lists (like <code>[4,1,2,1,1,3]</code>) hold sequences of values, and might have repeated elements.</p>
<p>Since lists are <em>passed by reference</em> to a function it is possible for a function to modify their contents, changing the values stored in them as a <em>side effect</em> of the function’s execution. When you write your code pay careful attention as to whether we want your function to change the list it is given, or instead whether we want you to build and return a new list (perhaps based on a list that you are given).</p>
<h1 id="Problems"><a href="#Problems" class="headerlink" title="Problems"></a>Problems</h1><h2 id="HW5-P1-down-up"><a href="#HW5-P1-down-up" class="headerlink" title="[HW5 P1] down up"></a><code>[HW5 P1]</code> down up</h2><p>Write a function <code>def down_up(n)</code> that, when given a positive integer <code>n</code>, returns a list that contains a palindrome of counts as shown here:</p>

<p>That is, the returned list’s values should run from <code>n</code> down to 1, then back up to <code>n</code>.</p>

<p>Note that the list could be empty. In that case, the function should return a sum of 0.</p>

<p>because <code>0</code> occurs twice, <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> each occur once, <code>5</code> occurs three times, and <code>3</code> and <code>4</code> don’t occur. Here are a few more example uses of <code>counts</code>:</p>

<p>In the last two homeworks we practiced using two kinds of Python constructs that allow a programmer to “<em>control the flow</em>“ of the interpreter’s execution of statements in your program. These were (1) the <code>if</code> statement that provides conditional execution and (2) the <code>def</code> statement that provides a means for defining functions to help compute values.</p>
<p>With <em>conditional statements</em>, the program might skip past some blocks of statements, or it may execute one block versus another, all depending on some condition that’s checked by that <code>if</code> statement.</p>
<p>With <em>function definitions</em>, a program can jump to a named section of code to perform some actions, or to compute some result, all towards serving the work of the main script. These <code>def</code> statements act as useful “modules” that serve the main script. The <em>function call mechanism</em> which requires the calling code to pass <em>parameter values</em> to the function, and then (possibly) get a value upon the function’s <code>return</code>, imposes a discipline that helps the programmer structuretheir code in a readable way. Each function definitions provides a reusable code component.</p>
<p>This week we practice using Python’s <code>while</code> statement for structuring code. A <code>while</code> statement provides <em>iteration</em>: the program can execute a <em>loop</em>. It can repeatedly perform a series of actions until some condition is met. For example, the code below counts from 1 to<br>10. It keeps printing then adding one to the variable <code>count</code> until<br>that variable gets larger than 10:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;I will now count from 1 to 10...&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line">count = <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">while</span> count &lt;= <span class="number">10</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;The count is now &quot;</span> + <span class="built_in">str</span>(count) + <span class="string">&quot;.&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    count = count + <span class="number">1</span> // Increments the count variable by <span class="number">1.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;There. I am done counting.&quot;</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Here is what that code does: After executing the first two lines, the program will execute the <code>print</code> and the increment statements inside the <code>while</code> statement’s <em>body</em>. This is because the <code>count</code> variable is only at <code>1</code>, and that value is less than or equal to 10.  After executing those two lines once, the interpreter “jumps” back to the condition line to see whether <code>count &lt;= 10</code>. Since the condition is still true (<code>count == 2</code> and <code>2 &lt;= 10</code>), it runs those two lines again and re-checks the condition. It keeps looping through those three code lines– checking the condition, printing, incrementing– until the assignment statement changes the value of <code>count</code> from <code>10</code> to <code>11</code>. When the loop condition is checked an 11-th time, the condition will then be <code>False</code>, and the program skips to the line below the loop body. It prints the message “<code>There. I am done counting.</code>“</p>
<p>The problems below ask you to write functions that each work in this way.  You will use a <code>while</code> loop (or loops) to do each function’s work.</p>
<h2 id="Submission-and-Scoring"><a href="#Submission-and-Scoring" class="headerlink" title="Submission and Scoring"></a>Submission and Scoring</h2><p>Submit each source file containing a Python function definition, possibly with some other “helper” functions, to the Gradescope site.  The problems below are labeled the way they will appear as submission items in Gradescope.  We’ll run tests on your submission to see if your code is correct. Before submitting, you should test your function on several scenarios, making sure it works with a good variety of parameters. Only submit it when you have reasonable confidence that it is correct.</p>
<p>Some of the problems allow you to assume that a function’s client code won’t feed the function certain kinds of parameter values. When we allow you to make assumptions like that, your code need not check for parameters that aren’t assumed to happen.</p>
<p>Each problem is worth 30 points. 10 of the points are awarded based on the number of tests you pass. An additional prize of up to 10 points will be awarded if <em>all</em> the tests pass by the due date.  You’ll earn fewer of these prize points if you have to submit a problem several times to get all the tests to pass.</p>
<p>Another 10 points will be offered after the deadline based on the quality of your code. You should look for straight-forward solutions to solve the puzzle, and your code should be clear and easy to understand.  In cases where you feel the need to do something complicated– some programming puzzles require tricky coding– you should include comments that (briefly) explain your code’s approach.</p>

<p>$$1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \cdots + n^3$$</p>
<p>So, for example, <code>sum_cubes(3)</code> should evaluate to <code>36</code> because it is the sum of the first three cubes $1 + 8 + 27$.  For values of <code>n</code> that are less than <code>1</code>, your function should return <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>Place your function definition in a file named <code>sum_cubes.py</code> and test it with different values in the Python interpreter before you submit the code.</p>

That report should be in the form of a string that lists the divisors in order, starting with <code>1</code>.  If there are more than two divisors, it should use an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma">Oxford comma</a> before the mention of the last divisor.</p>
<p>Here is an example use of the function.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; divisors(35)</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;The divisors of 35 are 1, 5, 7, and 35.&#x27;</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; divisors(1)</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;The divisor of 1 is 1.&#x27;</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; divisors(2)</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;The divisors of 2 are 1 and 2.&#x27;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>It takes an integer and returns a string. <strong>The <code>divisors</code> function does not print anything.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong><br>Your function should seek to build a string by looping through all the possible divisors and appending them to that report string using the string concatenation operation <code>+</code>.  It then will want to append information to the front and back of that report. What it appends will depend on whether there is only one divisor, or two divisors, or more than two divisors.</p>
<p>Use integer division to figure out divisibility.</p>
<h2 id="HW4-P4-magnitude"><a href="#HW4-P4-magnitude" class="headerlink" title="[HW4 P4] magnitude"></a><code>[HW4 P4]</code> magnitude</h2><p>People often talk about the order of magnitude of an amount. In doing so, they are often thinking in terms of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0">powers of ten</a>.  Let’s instead give a very computer science-y definition of the <em>magnitude</em> of a number based on powers of two. The first seven powers of two are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. We’ll say that</p>
<ul>
<li>0 is of magnitude 0;</li>
<li>1 is of magnitude 1;</li>
<li>2 and 3 are of magnitude 2;</li>
<li>4, 5, 6, and 7 all are of magnitude 3;</li>
<li>the numbers from 8 to 15 are of magnitude 4;</li>
</ul>
<p>and so on. Note that 30 is of magnitude 5 because it is less than 32, and $32 &#x3D; 2^5$. But it is also that magnitude because dividing it by 2 yields 15, and 15 is magnitude 4. In other words, the number 30 has one more order of magnitude than 15 because it is twice as big, and because we have chosen to think in base two.</p>
<p>Write a function <code>magnitude</code> that returns the magnitude of a non-negative integer as we describe above. For example, your function’s code should work as follows:</p>

<p>You can assume <code>magnitude</code> is called only with numbers 0 or larger.</p>
<p><strong>Hint</strong>: The magnitude can be computed by counting the number of times you can divide by two until there is nothing left to divide.</p>
<p>You should not use any floating point operations to do this work. It turns out that the magnitude of a positive number is just the number of bits in its binary representation. Even so, you cannot use any Python-provided library functions that perform binary conversion.  You should instead compute this magnitude “from scratch” using integer division.</p>
<h2 id="HW4-P5-Euclid"><a href="#HW4-P5-Euclid" class="headerlink" title="[HW4 P5] Euclid"></a><code>[HW4 P5]</code> Euclid</h2><p>In the Western world, Euclid is often touted as the inventor of the first recorded algorithm. In Book VII of Euclid’s <em>Elements</em>, he lays out a description of determining whether two integers have a common divisor, or else are relatively prime. He writes</p>
<pre><code>&quot;***When two unequal numbers are set out, and the less is continually
subtracted in turn from the greater, if the number which is left
never measures the one before it until a unit is left, then the
original numbers are relatively prime.***&quot; (See the [Proposition](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookVII/propVII1.html))
</code></pre>
<p>He is describing an iterative process that starts with two positive integers.  If the two numbers are the same, then their common divisor is their whole self.  If instead one of the numbers is <code>1</code>– if it is “a unit”– then the process stops having determined that they have no common divisor. If the numbers differ and are both greater than <code>1</code>, then repeat the process using the smaller number of the pair along with the positive difference between the pair– the subtraction of the lesser from the greater.</p>
<p>Write a function <code>def euclid(a,b)</code> that performs Euclid’s algorithm to determine whether or not two positive numbers have a common divisor by performing this process.  For example, if the function is handed <code>15</code> and <code>24</code>, the process should repeat with <code>9</code> and <code>15</code> (because <code>9</code> equals <code>24 - 15</code>), and then <code>9</code> and <code>6</code>, and then <code>6</code> and <code>3</code>, and then <code>3</code> and <code>3</code>. Because these are equal, it stops and returns <code>True</code>. As another example, if the numbers it is given are <code>7</code> and <code>5</code>, then its process repeats with <code>5</code> and <code>2</code> (because <code>2</code> equals &#96;7</p>
<ul>
<li>5<code>), then with </code>3<code>and</code>2<code>, then </code>2<code>and</code>1<code>. Because one of these is </code>1<code>it then stops and returns</code>False&#96;.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your function can assume that its two parameters are both greater than 1. You need not worry about handling other kinds of parameters.</p>
<h2 id="HW4-P6-reverse-number"><a href="#HW4-P6-reverse-number" class="headerlink" title="[HW4 P6] reverse number"></a><code>[HW4 P6]</code> reverse number</h2><p>The table below illustrates an iterative process for examining the digits of a number.  In particular, it computes the number whose decimal digits are the reverse of that number:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="right">number</th>
<th align="right">reverse</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td align="right">53137</td>
<td align="right">0</td>

<tr>
<td align="right">5313</td>
<td align="right">7</td>

<tr>
<td align="right">531</td>
<td align="right">73</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="right">53</td>
<td align="right">731</td>

<tr>
<td align="right">5</td>
<td align="right">7313</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="right">0</td>
<td align="right">73135</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The first row starts with a number and also 0.  Each subsequent row of the table advances a calculation on those two numbers that has the effect of changing their digits. The first column gives the result of the number above it when it is divided by 10. The second column is the number above it, multiplied by 10, and with the last digit “lost” from the first column because of the division by 10 added to it. For example, the row with <code>531</code> and <code>73</code> is followed by a row containing <code>53</code> and <code>731</code> because <code>53 == 531 // 10</code> and because <code>731 == 73*10 + 1</code>.</p>
<p>In this exercise, generalize your code for <strong>[HW2 P3]</strong> so that it computes the reverse as shown in the table.  Write the code as a function <code>def reverse_number(n)</code> instead of as a script. (Put the definition in a file named <code>reverse_number.py</code>.)  It should take a non-negative integer <code>n</code> as a parameter and it should return the integer whose digits are the reverse of the decimal representation of <code>n</code>.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; reverse_number(53137)</span><br><span class="line">73135</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; reverse_number(0)</span><br><span class="line">0</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; reverse_number(2112)</span><br><span class="line">2112</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; reverse_number(1234567)</span><br><span class="line">7654321</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Your code should use only integer operations. It should not use floating point, nor should it convert the integer to a string to obtain the decimal digits. Instead, I recommend writing code that mimics the caclulations shown in the table just above.</p>
<h2 id="HW4-P7-count-palindromes"><a href="#HW4-P7-count-palindromes" class="headerlink" title="[HW4 P7] count palindromes"></a><code>[HW4 P7]</code> count palindromes</h2><p>A number is a <em>decimal palindrome</em> whenever it reads the same forwards and backwards.  For example <code>747</code>, <code>2112</code>, <code>0</code>, and <code>1234567654321</code> are all decimal palindromes.</p>
<p>Write a procedure <code>def count_palindromes(limit)</code> that gives the numbers from 0 up to <code>limit</code> that are decimal palindromes. For example:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; count_palindromes(999)</span><br><span class="line">109</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; count_palindromes(1000)</span><br><span class="line">109</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; count_palindromes(1001)</span><br><span class="line">110</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; count_palindromes(77)</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; count_palindromes(10)</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The last result is <code>10</code> because the single-digit numbers 0 through 9 are all decimal palindromes. The next-to-last result is <code>17</code> because 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, and 77 are also decimal palindromes.</p>

        <p><strong>Complete and submit by 2&#x2F;10 at 1:00pm</strong></p>
<p>We begin this homework with some borderline diplomacy. You will invent a friendly vending machine to help US citizens feel comfortable venturing into the great white northern country of Canada. Writing that script’s call will call on your Python skills to perform input, output, conditional execution, and integer division. It will be the great script named <code>canada.py</code>.</p>
<p>The remaining exercises each ask you to invent a Python <em>function</em>.  The Python file that you submit for each should contain that function’s definition using the <code>def</code> statement. We’ll talk more about this just below.  In short, they will not be interactive scripts. Instead, you will test your work by loading that definition’s file into the Python interpreter.  You’ll try out that function on a lot of different parameters, making sure that it returns the correct value in each case.</p>
<h2 id="On-Python-functions"><a href="#On-Python-functions" class="headerlink" title="On Python functions"></a>On Python functions</h2><p>This week we ask you, for exercises 2 through 7, to devise a Python function rather than a Python script. You’ll use the <code>def</code> statement to describe a function that computes and returns a value based on the values of the parameters that are passed to it.  For example, the fifth exercise has you write a function <code>stars</code>.  You’ll write code into a Python text file that includes a line</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">stars</span>(<span class="params">width, height</span>):</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Here, <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are the <em>formal parameters</em> that stand in for the <em>actual parameter</em> values sent to the function when it is used by other code. The lines after this <code>def</code> line describe the behavior of the function, <em>each line indented by 4 spaces</em>, ultimately <em>returning</em> a value that the function is asked to compute. (In the case of <code>stars</code>, the function will return a string of characters.)</p>
<p>Below, for example, is a function that performs temperature unit conversion, getting a temperature in degrees fahrenheit, then reporting the equivalent in degrees celsius:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">convert</span>(<span class="params">degrees_f</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    degrees_c = (degrees_f - <span class="number">32.0</span>) / <span class="number">9.0</span> * <span class="number">5.0</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> degrees_c</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Using this function’s code is a bit different than running a script’s code. We need to call the function in order to use its code. One way to test the code is to load the function definition into an <em>interactive</em> Python session, and then call the function with some parameters.  If, for example, we imagine that the <code>convert</code> function is defined in a source file <code>convert.py</code>, we could do the following:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H samples % python3 -i convert.py </span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; convert(212.0)</span><br><span class="line">100.0</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; convert(32.0)</span><br><span class="line">0.0</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; convert(-40.0)</span><br><span class="line">-40.0</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Here, because we ran the Python command with <code>-i</code>, the code was loaded <em>interactively</em>, and we are able to test the function within the Python interpreter.</p>
<p>When an exercise asks you to write a single function, it is more than okay to define <em>other</em> functions in the same <code>.py</code> file, ones that you use to help you compute the value expected for that one specified function. Indeed, writing these <em>helper functions</em> can sometimes be a great way to structure your code, especially since it allows you to test portions of your work—to get those subcomponents working—as you construct the function they serve.</p>
<p>For many of these functions you’ll want to use <code>if</code> statements to do their calculations. Also, you want to <code>return</code> the computed results rather than use <code>print</code> statements.  Functions return values.</p>
<h2 id="Submission-and-Autograding"><a href="#Submission-and-Autograding" class="headerlink" title="Submission and Autograding"></a>Submission and Autograding</h2><p>Submit each Python source file containing your script code to the Gradescope site. The problems below are labeled the way they will appear as submission items in Gradescope.  As before, we’ll run a series of tests on a problem submission to see if your code is correct. The autograder will your scripts, trying out different input strings. It checks to see whether the lines output by <code>print</code> match what we expect. Before submitting, you should run your scripts several times, and with different inputs, to make sure that your code is working. Only submit it when you have reasonable confidence that it is correct.</p>
<p>It’s hard to anticipate every possible input, but you should work to anticipate as much as you can.</p>
<p>Some of the problems allow you to assume that a user won’t enter certain kinds of inputs. When we allow you to make assumptions like that, you do not need to check inputs that aren’t assumed to happen.</p>
<h2 id="Scoring"><a href="#Scoring" class="headerlink" title="Scoring"></a>Scoring</h2><p>Each problem is worth 30 points. 10 of the points are awarded based on the number of tests you pass. An additional prize of up to 10 points will be awarded if <em>all</em> the tests pass by the due date.  You’ll earn fewer of these prize points if you have to submit a problem several times to get all the tests to pass.

<p>You’ve been hired by the Canadian government to design a vending machine.  It will be placed just north of the US-Canadian border, providing some information about how temperature readings differ in Canada, and offering visitors the opportunity to purchase bags from a variety of potato chips.  The vending machine is driven by a Python script that you will write.</p>
<p>Get it all correct, and Canada will thank you for your fine effort.</p>
<p>Here is a sample interaction with the script you write:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">||||          ||||</span><br><span class="line">||||  _/TT\_  ||||</span><br><span class="line">||||  \\||//  ||||</span><br><span class="line">||||  &#x27;-||-&#x27;  ||||</span><br><span class="line">||||          ||||</span><br><span class="line">Welcome to Canada!</span><br><span class="line">------------------</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Enter the current temperature in whole degrees Celsius: 30</span><br><span class="line">That means that it is 86 degrees Fahrenheit outside.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Let&#x27;s get the cost of potato chips here in Canadian dollars and cents...</span><br><span class="line">Enter the number of dollars per bag of chips: 2</span><br><span class="line">Enter the number of cents per bag of chips: 20</span><br><span class="line">Okay.

[hit RETURN]: </span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Thank you! Here are your pickle chips.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>As you can see, the first seven lines greet the visitor with a welcome message.  That greeting is followed by a blank line and a prompt for the current temperature. You should expect them to enter the temperature as a whole number in degrees celsius, and then your script should report the temperature as a whole number in degrees Fahrenheit so that US visitors will be well-informed about the weather.</p>
<p>After that, a blank line is output and then the vending machine asks for three integers– the cost in Canadian dollars and cents of a bag of potato chips and also the number of bags of chips they would like to purchase. (<strong>Note:</strong> your code must replicate the “<code>bags would you like</code>“ typo in the interaction.)</p>
<p>In a typical interaction like what’s shown above, a user will want <em>some</em> bags of chips and the chips cost <em>some</em> money. If so, it immediately asks them to enter (a string) for the flavor of chips they prefer. In a typical interaction, also, they will enter one of <code>plain</code>, <code>pickle</code>, or <code>ketchup</code>.</p>
<p>The script should finish by printing a blank line outputting the total purchase cost as <code>$D.CC</code> where <code>D</code> is the total dollars, one or more digits long, starting with the first non-zero digit if more than one digit. And <code>CC</code> is the number of cents as two digits.  It should then tell the user what number of two- and one-dollar coins to insert. (The machine only takes these two kinds of whole-dollar coins).</p>
<ul>
<li>If they only need to insert one dollar the request should be for “<code>1 loonie</code>“.</li>
<li>If instead they need to insert two dollars the request should be for “<code>1 toonie</code>“. </li>
<li>If three dollars the request should be for “<code>1 toonie and 1 loonie</code>“.</li>
<li>If four dollars say “<code>2 toonies</code>“.</li>
<li>If five then “<code>2 toonies and 1 loonie</code>“.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on. Note that it should request at most one one-dollar loonie coin.</p>
<p>In the example interaction above, because the total cost of $8.80 requires payment of nine whole Canadian dollars, the machine requests “<code>4 toonies and 1 loonie</code>“ and then waits for the user to hit their <code>[RETURN]</code> key.</p>
<p>Having done that, it thanks them for their purchase and gives a message describing what flavor of chips they are vended.</p>
<p>Below, we also describe less typical interactions, and how they should be handled by your code. These are the cases when:</p>
<ul>
<li>They choose to purchase 0 bags.</li>
<li>They purchase some bags of chips, but the chips cost no money.</li>
<li>They purchase some bags of chips, but they request a flavor that isn’t one of the three offered.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>A Transaction With No Chips Requested</strong></p>
<p>If they choose to purchase no chips by entering <code>0</code> for the number of bags, then the machine should not ask for the chip flavor or ask for money.  Instead, it should end the transaction with a blank line and the message</p>

<p>The vending machine interaction just ends with that “<code>beautiful weather</code>“ message at the end.</p>

<p><strong>A Transaction Where Chips Cost Nothing</strong></p>
<p>If they ask for <em>some</em> number of bags of chips, but the chips cost nothing, then the vending machine does not ask them to insert any money. Instead, it reports the total price of <code>$0.00</code> and ends the transaction by telling them to enjoy the flavor of chips they chose.</p>
<p>As an example, the script should behave like what’s below:</p>

<p><strong>A Transaction Where They Enter Some Other Flavor</strong></p>
<p>In cases where they request some bags of chips, they might enter a different flavor than the three requested. If they enter something other than <code>plain</code>, <code>pickle</code>, and <code>ketchup</code> then it should output a line immediately below <code>Enter the chip flavor...</code> that says</p>

<p>The remaining vending interaction should proceed as if they had entered <code>plain</code>, even though they entered some fourth flavor instead.</p>

<h2 id="HW3-P2-feet-to-meters"><a href="#HW3-P2-feet-to-meters" class="headerlink" title="[HW3 P2] feet to meters"></a><code>[HW3 P2]</code> feet to meters</h2><p>There are three feet in a yard and a yard is equal to 0.9144 meters. In a file called <code>feet_to_meters.py</code> define a function <code>feet_to_meters</code> that takes a value that represents a length in feet.  The function should calculate and return a value that is the equivalent length in meters. It should calculate this conversion using floating point numbers.</p>
<p>This means that this is the kind of code you should expect to write in<br><code>feet_to_meters.py</code>:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">feet_to_meters</span>(<span class="params">f</span>):</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Here, we are using <code>f</code> to represent a number that gets fed to the <code>feet_to_meters</code> function.  In the lines that follow you should have a line of code, or maybe several lines of code, that perform the conversion calculation. That code should work for any floating point value of <code>f</code>. Again that code should be <em>indented</em> and should ultimately <code>return</code> the value it calulates. It shouldn’t contain any <code>print</code> or <code>input</code> statements within its definition.</p>
<p>Here is an example test of that function within the Python interpreter:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H homework3 % python3 -i feet_to_meters.py </span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; feet_to_meters(10.0)</span><br><span class="line">3.048</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Note that, because of the nature of floating point, it is possible to get a <em>slightly</em> different result than the output above. That could happen because you used a different formula than we did.  When you submit your code our tests will tolerate slight differences in the numeric value, but will not tolerate significant differences.</p>
<p>Let me once again point out that your <code>feet_to_meters</code> function should <em>return</em> the converted value rather than <em>output</em> it using <code>print</code>. Printing values is very different than returning values. Ask us about this if you are unclear about this distinction.  Some of our testing won’t allow printing to happen within a function’s code.</p>
<h2 id="HW3-P3-coins"><a href="#HW3-P3-coins" class="headerlink" title="[HW3 P3] coins"></a><code>[HW3 P3]</code> coins</h2><p>In a file <code>coins.py</code>, write a function <code>coins</code> that, when given a number of cents, prints the number of US coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies) needed to make that amount. For example it should run like so</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H homework3 % python3 -i coins.py </span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>coins(<span class="number">11</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">2</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>because only two coins, a dime and a penny, are needed to make change of 11 cents.  Here are a few more examples:</p>

<h2 id="HW3-P4-stars"><a href="#HW3-P4-stars" class="headerlink" title="[HW3 P4] stars"></a><code>[HW3 P4]</code> stars</h2><p>The US is aware of Canada’s new vending technology. They are prototyping some Python code to produce “star fields” as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art">ASCII art</a>.  For example, the text below is made up of <code>50</code> asterisks:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">* * * * * *</span><br><span class="line"> * * * * *</span><br><span class="line">* * * * * *</span><br><span class="line"> * * * * *</span><br><span class="line">* * * * * *</span><br><span class="line"> * * * * *</span><br><span class="line">* * * * * *</span><br><span class="line"> * * * * *</span><br><span class="line">* * * * * *</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The console art above is 11 characters wide and 9 lines tall.  The lines alternate between a mix of asterisks and spaces, and spaces and asterisks.  Here is a version that is 4 characters wide (the first and last lines end with a space) and 3 lines tall:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">* *</span><br><span class="line"> * *</span><br><span class="line">* *</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>This one is 8 characters wide and 4 lines tall:</p>

<p>Towards this end, write a function <code>stars</code> in a file named <code>stars.py</code> that takes an integer <code>width</code> and integer <code>height</code>. It should return a string that, when printed, produces a star field of that number of characters wide, and that number of lines tall.</p>
<p>For example, you would want this Python interaction when loaded with <code>stars.py</code>:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>stars(<span class="number">6</span>,<span class="number">4</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">&#x27;* * * \n * * *\n* * * \n * * *\n&#x27;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>s = stars(<span class="number">6</span>,<span class="number">4</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="built_in">print</span>(s)</span><br><span class="line">* * *</span><br><span class="line"> * * *</span><br><span class="line">* * *</span><br><span class="line"> * * *</span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Notice that we make each line separated by the new line character<code>\n</code> be of the same length by using spaces judiciously.</p>
<p>You can assume that both <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are positive integers.</p>
<h2 id="HW3-P5-th"><a href="#HW3-P5-th" class="headerlink" title="[HW3 P5] th"></a><code>[HW3 P5]</code> th</h2><p>Write a function <code>def th(rank)</code> that takes a non-negative integer <code>rank</code> and returns a string giving the ranking suffix of that integer. For example:</p>

<p>All numbers other than 1, 2, and 3 should have a suffix of <code>th</code>, including 0. This means that your function should have this behavior:</p>

<p><strong>There is a bonus exercise at the end that fixes this behavior.</strong></p>
<h2 id="HW3-P6-cheapest"><a href="#HW3-P6-cheapest" class="headerlink" title="[HW3 P6] cheapest"></a><code>[HW3 P6]</code> cheapest</h2><p>Alice and Bob each own a moving company.

Bob’s truck can hold 14 boxes and he charges $250 per trip.</p>
<p>Write a function <code>cheapest</code> that takes as input the number of boxes a customer has and returns a string equal to the name of the person whose company would be cheaper. If the two companies would charge the same amount, have the function choose Alice’s over Bob’s.</p>
<p>For example, <code>cheapest(25)</code> returns <code>&#39;Bob&#39;</code> because Alice would charge $600 (three trips) and Bob would charge $500 (two trips), and so Bob charges less in that case.</p>

<p>You can assume the integer <code>number</code> is positive and less than 1000.</p>
<p>You might find it useful to write separate additional functions for the two conditions checked so as to determine whether <code>zap</code> and <code>buzz</code> should be output.</p>

<p>In this second homework we write a few more interactive scripts.  Some of these just rely on what you learned to complete Homework 1.  We’re giving you more practice with integer and string calculations, with <code>input</code>, and with <code>print</code>. Some also rely on integer division to do their reasoning about their inputs. And some give you a chance to practice using the <em>conditional statement</em> or “<em>if-else</em>“ statement so that their behavior can depend on conditions of the data input.</p>
<p>You can start work on these exercises in lab. They are all due in a week. We’ll talk more about the conditional statement in the coming lectures.</p>
<h2 id="On-Integer-Division"><a href="#On-Integer-Division" class="headerlink" title="On Integer Division"></a>On Integer Division</h2><p>Several exercises rely on integer division. This can be computed using the quotient operator <code>//</code> and the remainder operator <code>%</code>. Here is an example of their use:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="number">37</span> // <span class="number">10</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">3</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="number">37</span> % <span class="number">10</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">7</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>These two operations are critical for codes and for digital representations of numbers. For example, we can use integer division by 10 to determine a number’s digits because decimal representation uses a base of 10.  We can perform integer division by 2 to determine its <em>bits</em>. This is the <em>binary</em>, or base 2, representation. Mastering these operations now is going to be useful for understanding several computer concepts we introduce later.</p>
<p>Clever people that are new to programming will often invent code like</p>
<center>`dividend - divisor * math.floor(dividend / divisor)`</center>

<p>when they should learn to write</p>
<center>`dividend % divisor`</center>

<p>to compute the remainder due to a division.  The former code seems like the right idea. It says “<em>Perform the division, throwing out the fractional part with <code>floor</code>, that gives you a whole number. When you multiply it by the divisor, we can subtract that from the dividend to see what’s missing. That missing amount is the remainder.</em>“ While this makes sense, there is no reason to rely on floating point operations to perform integer division. Instead, you can directly use the <code>%</code> operation.</p>
<p>You should not need to use floating point in any of the exercises below. Instead, stick to using integers.</p>
<h2 id="The-Conditional-Statement"><a href="#The-Conditional-Statement" class="headerlink" title="The Conditional Statement"></a>The Conditional Statement</h2><p>In lecture we have begun to discuss how Python code can check its data to see if certain conditions are met. For example, we might have an integer variable <code>number</code> and we might check to see if it is a ranking from 1 to 100. Here is a script that does that:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">number = <span class="built_in">int</span>(<span class="built_in">input</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Enter a ranking from 1 to 100: &quot;</span>))</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> (number &lt; <span class="number">1</span>) <span class="keyword">or</span> (number &gt; <span class="number">100</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;The integer &quot;</span>+<span class="built_in">str</span>(number)+<span class="string">&quot; is not a rank.&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;That was a bad entry.&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">else</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Thanks!&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;The number &quot;</span>+<span class="built_in">str</span>(number)+<span class="string">&quot; is indeed a rank.&quot;</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>In the code above, the expression <code>(number &lt; 1)</code> is true whenever the integer they entered is 0 or smaller. And the expression <code>(number &gt; 100)</code> is true if the integer they entered is 101 or greater.  If either condition holds, then the script tells them that the number is not a ranking. Otherwise, it thanks them for their entry of a rank from 1 to 100.</p>
<p>The four lines of code starting with <code>if</code> is a conditional statement. It has the general syntax</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">if condition-to-check :</span><br><span class="line">    lines-to-execute-if-the-condition-holds</span><br><span class="line">else:</span><br><span class="line">    lines-to-execute-otherwise</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The statements in the lines immediately following the <code>if</code> line must be indented, and with four spaces. They are executed whenever the condition checked is true. The statements immediately following the <code>else:</code> line should also each be indented with four spaces. They are executed whenever the condition checked is false.</p>
<p>We will talk more about the <em>if-else</em> statement in lecture, and you will want to use it to finish some of the exercises below.</p>
<h2 id="Submission-and-Autograding"><a href="#Submission-and-Autograding" class="headerlink" title="Submission and Autograding"></a>Submission and Autograding</h2><p>Submit each Python source file containing your script code to the Gradescope site. The problems below are labeled the way they will appear as submission items in Gradescope.  As before, we’ll run a series of tests on a problem submission to see if your code is correct. The autograder will your scripts, trying out different input strings. It checks to see whether the lines output by <code>print</code> match what we expect. Before submitting, you should run your scripts several times, and with different inputs, to make sure that your code is working. Only submit it when you have reasonable confidence that it is correct.</p>
<p>It’s hard to anticipate every possible input, but you should work to anticipate as much as you can.</p>
<p>Some of the problems allow you to assume that a user won’t enter certain kinds of inputs. When we allow you to make assumptions like that, you do not need to check inputs that aren’t assumed to happen.</p>
<h2 id="Scoring"><a href="#Scoring" class="headerlink" title="Scoring"></a>Scoring</h2><p>Each problem is worth 30 points. 10 of the points are awarded based on the number of tests you pass. An additional prize of up to 10 points will be awarded if <em>all</em> the tests pass by the due date.  You’ll earn fewer of these prize points if you have to submit a problem several times to get all the tests to pass. Another 10 points will be given after the deadline as a result of our own assessment of the quality of your code.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>test score:</strong> <em>(automated)</em> partial or full credit for passing each test</li>
<li><strong>prize score:</strong> <em>(automated)</em> additional credit for passing all the tests before the deadline</li>

<h1 id="Problems"><a href="#Problems" class="headerlink" title="Problems"></a>Problems</h1><h2 id="HW2-P1-menu"><a href="#HW2-P1-menu" class="headerlink" title="[HW2 P1] menu"></a><code>[HW2 P1]</code> menu</h2><p>A friend in the restaurant business has asked you to develop a Python script for typesetting menus for his restaurants.  Below is one he produced by hand on a typewriter for his fancy bistro called “Bobby’s”:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">1234567890123456789012345678901234567890</span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">Bobby&#x27;s Entrees				</span><br><span class="line">---------------</span><br><span class="line">Pasta verde.........................$ 15</span><br><span class="line">Filet mignon w/ lobster and caviar..$107</span><br><span class="line">Hamburger with fries................$  9</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>In the top line, he decided to show that the menus are 40 columns wide. There is a blank line, followed by the restaurant “Entrees” lines, followed by the three entree lines.</p>
<p>Write a script <code>menu.py</code> that produces these menus as output. It should take the restaurant name as input, and then it should take three input strings for the names of three different entrees, along with their prices in whole dollars. Each menu that your program outputs is 7 lines long and includes the top line with the column numbers.</p>
<p>Here is a sample interaction:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Restaurant name? Bobby&#x27;s</span><br><span class="line">First entree? Pasta verde	 </span><br><span class="line">First entree price? 15</span><br><span class="line">Second entree? Filet mignon w/ lobster and caviar</span><br><span class="line">Second entree price? 107</span><br><span class="line">Third entree? Hamburger with fries</span><br><span class="line">Third entree price? 9</span><br><span class="line">    		</span><br><span class="line">1234567890123456789012345678901234567890</span><br><span class="line">    		</span><br><span class="line">Bobby&#x27;s Entrees</span><br><span class="line">---------------</span><br><span class="line">Pasta verde.........................$ 15</span><br><span class="line">Filet mignon w/ lobster and caviar..$107</span><br><span class="line">Hamburger with fries................$  9</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You can assume that entree prices are under a 1000 dollars, and so you should use three columns for formatting their digits. You can also assume that the entree names they enter will fit, along with their price, within the 40 columns. That is, for example, the “Filet mignon…”  entry is one character shorter than the longest string for an item that your script will ever face.</p>
<p>Note that to do this you’ll need to use some combination of the string concatenation, repetition, and length operations, just as in the <code>marquee</code> exercise from the last homework. You’ll also want to convert integers to strings to get the price spacing right.</p>
<h2 id="HW2-P2-tens-digit"><a href="#HW2-P2-tens-digit" class="headerlink" title="[HW2 P2] tens digit"></a><code>[HW2 P2]</code> tens digit</h2><p>In a file called <code>tens_digit.py</code>, write a script that takes an input. It should then report the tens digit of that integer.  You can assume that the integer they enter is 10 or larger. You need not worry about handling smaller integers.</p>
<p>Here is the interaction in the terminal that we expect with your script:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">jimfix@fix-computer homework2 % python3 tens_digit.py</span><br><span class="line">Enter an integer that is larger than 9: 1234</span><br><span class="line">It has a tens digit of 3.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Your code should use the integer division operations, namely the quotient operator <code>//</code> and the remainder operator <code>%</code> to perform this calculation.</p>
<p>Note that there are Python library functions that convert integers to strings of digit characters, and then string operations to extract these digits.  <em>Please don’t use those string operations in your code.</em></p>
<h2 id="HW2-P3-reverse"><a href="#HW2-P3-reverse" class="headerlink" title="[HW2 P3] reverse"></a><code>[HW2 P3]</code> reverse</h2><p>Write a script <code>reverse.py</code> that takes a 3-digit integer as its input.  It should then print the number that has the same three digits but in reverse order. For example, below is the kind of interaction we expect to have with your code. We are running the script three times in a row, each time entering a different integer.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">jimfix@fix-computer homework2 % python3 reverse.py</span><br><span class="line">Enter a 3-digit integer: 345</span><br><span class="line">543</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@fix-computer homework2 % python3 reverse.py</span><br><span class="line">Enter a 3-digit integer: 719</span><br><span class="line">917</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@fix-computer homework2 % python3 reverse.py</span><br><span class="line">Enter a 3-digit integer: 999</span><br><span class="line">999</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You can assume that the script is given an integer that is not divisible by 10.  You can also assume that the function is given an integer that is greater than 100 and less than 1000.</p>
<p>Please <strong>do not</strong> use string operations to determine the digits of an integer.  Just as in the “tens digit” problem, you should use integer division operations <code>//</code> and <code>%</code> to determine the digits of the number.</p>
<h2 id="HW2-P4-n-th-digit"><a href="#HW2-P4-n-th-digit" class="headerlink" title="[HW2 P4] n-th digit"></a><code>[HW2 P4]</code> n-th digit</h2><p>Write a script named <code>nth_digit.py</code> that takes two integer inputs. You can assume that both inputs are non-negative. The second integer is used to describe a digit position of the first. The script should then report that digit in that position within the digits of the first number.</p>
<p>It should behave exactly as follows:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">jimfix@fix-computer homework2 % python3 nth_digit.py </span><br><span class="line">Enter a non-negative integer: 957</span><br><span class="line">Enter a digit position: 1</span><br><span class="line">The 10s digit of that intger is 5.</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@fix-computer homework2 % python3 nth_digit.py </span><br><span class="line">Enter a non-negative integer: 957</span><br><span class="line">Enter a digit position: 2</span><br><span class="line">The 100s digit of that intger is 9.</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@fix-computer homework2 % python3 nth_digit.py </span><br><span class="line">Enter a non-negative integer: 957</span><br><span class="line">Enter a digit position: 0</span><br><span class="line">The 1s digit of that integer is 7.</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@fix-computer homework2 % python3 nth_digit.py </span><br><span class="line">Enter a non-negative integer: 957</span><br><span class="line">Enter a digit position: 3</span><br><span class="line">The 1000s digit of that integer is 0.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Note that, in the above examples, we are numbering the digits from right to left, starting at 0, and so we are working from the least-significant digit to the most-significant digit.  This means that position 0 corresponds to the ones place, position 1 corresponds to the tens place, position 2 corresponds to the hundreds place, and so on.</p>
<p>Treat positions that are “off to the left” of the digits of the integer as being 0 digits. It’s as if there is an infinite supply of 0s sitting to the left of the actual digits of that number.</p>
<p>You can assume neither number entered is negative.</p>
<p>Just as in the earlier two problems where you are asked to determine the digits of an integer, we ask that you not convert the integer to a string to perform this function’s calculation.  Instead, you should use the integer division operations <code>//</code> and <code>%</code> to determine the number’s digits.</p>
<h2 id="HW2-P5-toonies"><a href="#HW2-P5-toonies" class="headerlink" title="[HW2 P5] toonies"></a><code>[HW2 P5]</code> toonies</h2><p>You decide to visit Canada to do some shopping. You’ve become fond of their one-dollar coin, called a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loonie">“loonie”</a> because its backside depicts a common loon. You are even more fond of their two-dollar coin called a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toonie">“toonie”</a>.  You like the toonie so much, you decide to pay for everything using these two-dollar coins.</p>
<p>Devise a script <code>toonies.py</code> that, when given an item’s cost in Canadian dollars, expresses how many toonies you need to pay for that item. Your script should have this kind of interaction:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">C02MX1KLFH04:homework2 jimfix$ python3 toonies.py </span><br><span class="line">Item cost in Canadian dollars? 21</span><br><span class="line">Pay 11 toonies.</span><br><span class="line">C02MX1KLFH04:homework2 jimfix$ python3 toonies.py </span><br><span class="line">Item cost in Canadian dollars? 20</span><br><span class="line">Pay 10 toonies.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You can assume that the item’s price is a whole dollar amount and at least three dollars. (This means that you’ll never calculate payments of fewer than two toonies.) You should only be using integer calculations for this script. You shouldn’t even need to use the conditional statement.</p>
<p>We are interested here in the evenness and oddness of the payment amount, so you’d look at the amount’s divisibility by two.</p>
<h2 id="HW2-P6-zap-buzz"><a href="#HW2-P6-zap-buzz" class="headerlink" title="[HW2 P6] zap buzz"></a><code>[HW2 P6]</code> zap buzz</h2><p><em>Zap-Buzz</em> is a variant of a common children’s game. The way the game works is that each person takes a turn saying a number, counting upwards from 1. However, if the number is a multiple of 7 they say “zap” instead of the number. If the number has a digit of 3 in it they say “buzz” instead of the number, and if both things are true they say “zap buzz”.</p>
<p>Devise a script <code>zap_buzz.py</code> that plays a turn of the game.  It should take a positive integer input. It should then print that integer if neither of the “zap”&#x2F;“buzz” conditions hold.  If some condition holds, print <code>zap</code>, or print <code>buzz</code>, or print <code>zap buzz</code>, whichever is appropriate. You are allowed to assume the parameter is less than 1000.

        <p><strong>Complete and submit Part 1 in lab</strong><br><strong>Submit Part 2 by 1&#x2F;29 at 11:00pm</strong></p>
<p>In this first homework we set-up the software necessary for completing and submitting your work throughout the semester, and we try out some Python programming. By the end of this homework you’ll have run the Python interpreter, written some Python code, tested that code, and submitted it to us so that we can take a look at it. In doing so, you will interact through Gradescope with <code>aga</code>, our automated system that works to check your work and tries its best to give you feedback on it. (<code>aga</code> is named as such because (<code>a</code>)ga (<code>g</code>)rades (<code>a</code>)ssignments!)</p>
<p>You can then start work on the programming exercises to be completed in the next week.</p>
<h1 id="Part-1-Set-Up"><a href="#Part-1-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Set-Up"></a>Part 1: Set-Up</h1><p>Before we dive deeply into the material of the course we first need to make sure your computer has all the software it needs for the course. This first part of the assignment walks you through that process. We have tried to include instructions for all the situations that might arise, but if anything isn’t working, you can work with us to get things set up right.</p>
<p>Here are the steps we take you through:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Join Gradescope</strong> where you’ll submit the work.</li>
<li><strong>Obtain a text editor.</strong> We use this for writing code.</li>
<li><strong>Set up a terminal console</strong> to run Python code.</li>
<li><strong>Obtain Python 3.</strong> This tool knows the Python programming language.</li>
<li><strong>Try the tools</strong> to create two text files.</li>
</ul>
<p>How you take these steps will depend on your computer system. For each we will give you ways of checking whether your set up was successful. When you’ve completed these steps and checks, you’ll submit two files using Gradescope and then move on to Part 2.</p>
<h2 id="Join-the-Gradescope-course"><a href="#Join-the-Gradescope-course" class="headerlink" title="Join the Gradescope course"></a>Join the Gradescope course</h2><p>Your first step is to create a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gradescope.com/">Gradescope</a> account associated with your Reed email. In doing so you can join the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/490535">CSCI 121 Spring 2023 course</a> on Gradescope by using the course code we’ll provide in this lab. You need to join Gradescope in order to submit the work of this assignment and all the future assignments.</p>
<h2 id="Get-a-text-editor"><a href="#Get-a-text-editor" class="headerlink" title="Get a text editor"></a>Get a text editor</h2><p>You will write your code in a text editor, and there are lots of options to pick from. As your next step, install one of the following editors for your system by following its link:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"><strong>Visual Studio Code</strong></a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a></li>
<li>Mac: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"><strong>Visual Studio Code</strong></a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://macromates.com/download">TextMate</a>, vim, emacs, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://aquamacs.org/">AquaMacs</a></li>
<li>Linux: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux"><strong>Visual Studio Code</strong></a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, vim, emacs, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit">Gedit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In lab and lecture we will encourage you to use Visual Studio <strong>Code</strong>, heareafter named <strong>VS Code</strong>, because Microsoft has made it freely available (on Windows <em>and</em> on the Mac). They have designed it to be simple and lightweight (compared to their bloated <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio</a> which we <strong>do not</strong> recommend).  <strong>VS Code</strong> is designed in the spirit of many good and flexible program editors from the free software community.  <strong>Atom</strong> is another good editor that many Reed CS students have adopted, and that CSCI 121 used in recent past, but the group that invented it has announced that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/">it will no longer be supported after December of 2021</a>.  Both editors have a lot of features for writing Python code. They can be configured to do many other programming tasks too, and they both handle code in many other programming languages.</p>
<p>Note that many shared CS computers used for upper-level classes are configured with the <em>console-based</em> editors <code>vim</code> and <code>emacs</code> (as opposed to <em>window-based</em> or <em>GUI</em> editors). The two editors are touted by many programmers and are great to learn, but they’re not as beginner-friendly as the others.  They are great to learn at some point as you learn CS. Maybe wait to try them a few weeks into the course. We ourselves will sometimes use <code>emacs</code> in live demonstrations because we use it in our own work.</p>
<p>You should not use editors that you might use for writing HUM110 papers (like <strong>Word</strong>) for writing program code! Editors for programming create <em>plain text</em> files, which really just contain the “raw” characters of your program’s text (no fonts, no decorations, etc.) so they can be processed and read by a variety of programming tools. If you tried to load, say, a <strong>Word</strong> document into Python, Python would just get confused.</p>
<p>Once you have chosen a text editor, download it. Make sure it opens correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Tabs and spaces</strong></p>
<p>If you aren’t using <strong>VS Code</strong> then you <em>might</em> also need to configure your editor so that it handles Python code well. In particular, you need to make sure it handles the <strong>[tab]</strong> key in a coding-friendly way.  Your text editor needs to be set so that hitting the tab key actually inserts 4 spaces rather than a tab. This is crucial because Python is sensitive to how you indent portions of code, using that indentation to figure out what to do. It can get confused when it sees a mix of tabs and spaces in your code, so it’s best to configure it to treat tab keypresses as spaces.  <strong>VS Code</strong> already does this by default when you are editing a Python code file.</p>
<p>This is often easy to configure, but the process for doing it is a little different for each one, and so you’ll need to figure that out for the one you chose to use. If you have trouble, ask a TA for help. For example, <strong>Atom</strong> can be configured by following the steps in the appendix at the bottom of this page.</p>
<h2 id="Make-coursework-folders"><a href="#Make-coursework-folders" class="headerlink" title="Make coursework folders"></a>Make coursework folders</h2><p>Make a folder called <code>csci121</code> where all your work for this course will be kept, and put it in your computer user’s <code>Documents</code> folder. In the instructions below, we assume you do this. Some people find other locations more convenient, say under <code>Desktop</code> or else directly within the your computer user’s home folder. If you decide to use a different location than <code>Documents/csci121</code> you will have to re-interpret our instructions and example computer interactions accordingly.</p>
<p>Once you have this folder, create a folder inside it called <code>homework1</code> (you’ll do this for each homework or project).  Now download these two files into that folder:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./survey.txt">survey.txt</a></li>
<li><a href="./test.py">test.py</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Start-a-terminal-console"><a href="#Start-a-terminal-console" class="headerlink" title="Start a terminal console"></a>Start a terminal console</h2><p>Most computer systems provide a <em>terminal program</em> so you can work with your computer’s system— run applications and programs, move files and folders around, do low-level tweaks— using a <em>command line console</em>, that is, by having you type commands rather than point and click. This is a typical way many programmers work, especially when they need to run their own code as it develops, and to run scripts, say to automate lots of activities like testing code and working with data files.</p>
<p>We will type console commands into a terminal to run our Python programs.  Mac and Linux already have a terminal program included with the operating system, one that is based on the Unix system. If you have a Mac or Linux, you can just run <strong>Terminal</strong> and that should bring up a window that looks like the console of a 1970s computer.  Windows machines have a tool called <strong>Powershell</strong> that mimics a Unix terminal on their system.  (You can find it by searching for <code>powershell</code> within the Windows Explorer search bar.)</p>
<p>A <strong>terminal console</strong> will only display text, it will display that text in a typewriter font, and it will come up waiting for you to type in a command after printing a prompt.  Here, for example, is what my terminal console looks like when I start<br>it on my Mac:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Last login: Fri Aug 26 06:06:50 on ttys002</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H ~ %</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The first line is a brief system message. The second line is an elaborate prompt up until the <code>% </code> where the system waits for me to enter a command. The full prompt is in the format:</p>
<p>   <code> </code><em>My-User’s-Name</em> <code>@</code> <em>My-Machine’s-Name</em><code> </code><em>Working-Folder</em><code> %</code></p>
<p>My user’s name is <code>jimfix</code>, my computer (for some reason) is called <code>C02F48U1ML7H</code>, and the folder that <strong>Terminal</strong> is working in is my user’s home folder on my computer, abbreviated as <code>~</code>. I can run programs that inspect files in that folder, and I can switch to other folders, and so forth. Here is a longer transcript of a <strong>Terminal</strong> session:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Last login: Fri Aug 26 06:06:50 on ttys002</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H ~ % uname -srm</span><br><span class="line">Darwin 19.6.0 x86_64</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H ~ % pwd</span><br><span class="line">/Users/jimfix</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H ~ % cd ~/git/jimfix.github.io/csci121/lectures/week1/examples</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H examples % ls</span><br><span class="line">circle.py		hello5.py		radius_functions.py</span><br><span class="line">csci11squared.py	hello6.py		radius_import.py</span><br><span class="line">csci121.py		hello_calc.py		shoutout.py</span><br><span class="line">hello.py		integers.py		shoutout4x.py</span><br><span class="line">hello3.py		integers_divide.py	temperature.py</span><br><span class="line">hello4.py		radius.py</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H examples % grep sqrt *.py</span><br><span class="line">radius_functions.py:    from math import pi, sqrt</span><br><span class="line">radius_functions.py:    return sqrt(someArea / pi)</span><br><span class="line">radius_import.py:from math import pi, sqrt</span><br><span class="line">radius_import.py:radius = sqrt(area / pi)</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H examples %</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Each line starting with <code>jimfix</code> ends with a command I typed after <code>%</code>.  Any subsequent lines show the system’s response to that command. For example, the <code>pwd</code> command showed me the full name of the folder I’m working within.</p>
<p>We’ll demonstrate a few more of these commands in later steps.</p>
<p><strong>Other options for running a terminal</strong></p>
<p>It turns out that the <strong>VS Code</strong> editor has the ability to run a terminal console. In <strong>VS Code</strong> select the menu item <em>Terminal &gt; New Terminal</em>.  This will open up a terminal console just at the bottom of the editor.  On a Mac system, this will run the <code>zsh</code> tool that is also run inside Mac’s <strong>Terminal</strong> program. On a Windows system, this will run <code>powershell</code>.</p>
<p>For Windows machines, we offer two more options in the appendices on <a href="#appendices/appendix:gettingawindowsterminalusinggittools">Git tools</a> and <a href="#appendices/appendix:gettingawindowsterminalusingwsl">WSL</a> at the bottom of this document. Since Mac and Linux are actually flavors of the Unix operating system, the commands we type are actually part of their system. In Windows, <code>powershell</code> is emulating those commands to run things in Windows. Because of the fact that Windows is a different system, historically Windows users have had to have complicated solutions to get a terminal console that offers Unix-like commands. The appendices give you two other, more expert ways of emulating a Unix console environment on Windows.</p>
<h2 id="Install-Python"><a href="#Install-Python" class="headerlink" title="Install Python"></a>Install Python</h2><p>The next piece of software you’ll want to put on your computer is Python.  If you have a Mac, Python 2 comes pre-installed, but this is not the version we will be using.  You should instead download the latest version of Python 3 (currently 3.10.6) <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>.  Make sure to pick the correct download for your operating system.  Follow the instructions on that site to download and install Python 3.</p>
<p>If you have a Windows machine you can install Python 3 the same way. Go to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">the Python website</a> and get the Windows version. Alternatively, you could open the Microsoft Store on your computer and search for Python. Make sure to select the latest version, which currently is Python 3.10.</p>
<p>(If you use Linux or installed the Ubuntu WSL (see Appendix at the end of this page), these already have Python 3 installed. You don’t need to do anything!)</p>
<h2 id="Play-with-Python"><a href="#Play-with-Python" class="headerlink" title="Play with Python"></a>Play with Python</h2><p>Bring up a terminal. Once you get a command prompt, you can enter the Python 3 command. For nearly all of you, this should be <code>python3</code>.  For some Windows users this may instead be <code>py</code> or <code>python</code>. Here is a Mac terminal session that starts Python 3:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H ~ % python3</span><br><span class="line">Python 3.9.10 (main, Jan 15 2022, 11:48:15) </span><br><span class="line">[Clang 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.29)] on darwin</span><br><span class="line">Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The key thing that you should see is the <strong>Python prompt</strong> <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>.  (Not to be confused with the <strong>command prompt</strong>!) Here you can type individual lines of Python code and watch them be evaluated immediately.  If you type <code>4+5</code> and then press the <code>[return]</code> key, it should print <code>9</code> on the next line and give you a new <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt.  Try each of the Python code suggested below and make sure that you get the same responses.  The lines starting with <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> contain the code you should type at the prompt.  The other lines should appear automatically as responses.</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="number">18</span> % <span class="number">4</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>x = <span class="number">7</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="built_in">print</span>(x)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">7</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="keyword">from</span> math <span class="keyword">import</span> pi</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>pi</span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">3.141592653589793</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>quit()</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The last line with <code>quit()</code> tells Python to exit and should return you back to the terminal, at which point you get back the command prompt. As before, at the command prompt, you can enter console commands, not Python expressions. </p>
<h2 id="Run-a-Python-program"><a href="#Run-a-Python-program" class="headerlink" title="Run a Python program"></a>Run a Python program</h2><p>We now want to run the <code>test.py</code> file, which contains a Python program.  To do this, we need to learn some more Unix commands.  For now, we will learn <code>cd</code> (change directory, i.e. folder) and <code>ls</code> (list a folder’s contents).</p>
<p>When you’re working in the terminal, your computer keeps track of the folder you are currently working in. Each session starts by default in your computer user’s home folder. If you ever want to return directly to that home folder, you can type the <code>cd</code> command.  You can display the contents of the folder you’re in (both sub-folders and files) by typing the <code>ls</code> command. If the folder you’re in contains the sub-folder named <code>inner</code>, you get to it by typing <code>cd inner</code>.  If you want to move up one level into the parent folder containing the current folder, you do it with the <code>cd ..</code> command. For example, on my Mac, I might use the following commands below to navigate to the folder for this assignment.</p>

<p>In the terminal interaction lines above, there are prompts for a command line (e.g. <code>jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H homework1 %</code>) and I have typed the commands that follow the percent sign. In the first line, I went to my home folder, and then used three commands to go into <code>~/Documents/csci121/homework1</code> . Finally, I entered <code>pwd</code> just to verify where I was working and then <code>ls</code> to inspect the contents of that folder.</p>
<p>Play around with the commands to get used to this kind of navigation. Should you get lost during this play, you can always type the command <code>pwd</code> (print the “working”, or current, directory) to see where you are.</p>
<p>Once you are in your <code>homework1</code> folder the command <code>ls</code> should list the two files we have put there, <code>test.py</code> and <code>survey.txt</code>.  Now, enter the Python command, just like you did earlier, but include the file name <code>test.py</code> on that same line, like so.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">python3 test.py</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>(Recall that if this Python command doesn’t work, you can try typing <code>py</code>, or perhaps <code>python3.10</code> or <code>python3.9</code> in case for some reason the system you’re using isn’t strictly what we’d expect from the instructions we gave above. On Windows, it might just be <code>python</code>.)</p>
<p>Entering this full command should run that program’s code, and it should print a number in the terminal.  Write this number down. You’ll need it in a minute.</p>
<h2 id="Problems-for-Part-1"><a href="#Problems-for-Part-1" class="headerlink" title="Problems for Part 1"></a>Problems for Part 1</h2><p>• <strong>[HW1 P1] survey</strong></p>
<p>Let’s begin working on the first two problems for this assignment. We’ll start by editing a simple text file in your text editor.</p>
<p>Use your chosen text editor to open the <code>survey.txt</code> file.  In it, you’ll see a bunch of survey questions meant to help us get to know you.  Type your answers below the questions, then save the modified file.</p>
<p>There. You’ve completed the first problem. If you would like, you can learn a little more about the Terminal console, and you can use it to verify the work. Go back to the Terminal and try out some of the commands below, assuming that its still working in the <code>homework1</code> folder:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H homework1 % ls -ltr</span><br><span class="line">total 16</span><br><span class="line">-rw-r--r--  1 jimfix  staff  108 Aug 27 09:12 test.py</span><br><span class="line">-rw-r--r--  1 jimfix  staff  735 Aug 27 09:34 survey.txt</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H homework1 % cat survey.txt</span><br><span class="line">1.

<p>The first command <code>ls -ltr</code> gives a more elaborate report of the contents of the <code>homework1</code> folder. It lists a (<code>l</code>)ong version of its files, according to their (<code>t</code>)imestamp, and in (<code>r</code>)everse order so that the most recently edited file appears at the bottom.  You’ll see that the number of characters in those text files are reported (the <code>108</code> and the <code>735</code> values) and the time that each was created or last edited.</p>
<p>The other two commands <code>cat</code> and <code>more</code> are two different ways of using the terminal to inspect the contents of a file. They both show the series of lines of <code>survey.txt</code>, though the <code>more</code> command does this interactively. It waits for you to hit <code>[space]</code> if the file contents go beyond a single screen’s worth of information, and to hit <code>q</code> or <code>[return]</code> (or probably most keys) when you are done looking at the file. The <code>cat</code> command just blasts all the contents out to the console without pause, even if it’s a large amount of text.</p>
<p>In both cases, you should expect to see the contents of the survey with your changes. </p>
<hr>
<p>• <strong>[HW1 P2] code</strong></p>
<p>Now let’s write some Python code.</p>
<p>Use the editor to create a new file where we will write the code of a Python program.  In <strong>VS Code</strong>, for example, you would want to select the menu item <em>File &gt; New Text File</em>. Having done that, the editor opens a new sub-window that has some helpful text written inside it. You should immediately click on the highlighted words <code>Select a language</code> on line 1 of that helpful text. Scroll through the options to find and select the Python language.</p>
<p>Now go ahead and type the following Python code into the file, replacing any initial text that the editor provided. The file should just be this code:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">first</span>(<span class="params">a, b</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    c = <span class="number">3</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> a &gt; b:</span><br><span class="line">        c = <span class="number">4</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> a**c - b</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You will want to literally type in the code, rather than cut and paste.  Some characters that appear in documents look the same but are not the same as the keys you would press yourself (double quotes and hyphens are notorious examples of this trickiness). Furthermore, you should make sure that you indent each of the lines after the first using spaces– 4 spaces for lines 2, 3, and 5; 8 spaces for line 4.  (If your editor is configured correctly to treat tabs as spaces, you can tab once for lines 2, 3, and 5; hit tab twice for line 4.)</p>
<p>Save the file with the above code as <code>code.py</code>.  Most text editors will now know that your file is a file of Python code and will color it accordingly, with specific colors assigned to functions, variables, etc.</p>
<p>You can verify that it was saved with <code>ls</code>, <code>cat</code>, or <code>more</code> in terminal if you like. You could also use your computer’s file browser to see if a new file named <code>code.py</code> has been created.</p>
<p><em>Trying out your Python code</em></p>
<p>Now I know that you probably followed our instructions well and copied the code verbatim.  Even so, you should want to see if the code works before you hand it in.  We will explain this more carefully in future lectures and labs, but there is no harm in just trying things out now.  In the terminal type the following command:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">python3 -i code.py</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>This is the same <code>python3</code> command you entered earlier along with some extra information.  This runs the program you’ve written in a different way. It reads in the code in <code>code.py</code> code first, and then allows you to <em>interact</em> with Python, prompting you for more Python code. For example, here is a session that I ran with my code in the terminal:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H homework1 % python3 -i code.py</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; first(100,1)</span><br><span class="line">99999999</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; quit()</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H homework1 %</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Here, I enter the Python command, and then I enter a Python expression after the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt.  Python responds on the next line with a number computed from the expression <code>first(100,1)</code> If instead you see errors rather than an integer, talk with a TA.  To stop playing with the code within Python, Enter <code>quit()</code> at a <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt to leave the Python system and go back to entering terminal commands.</p>
<p>Understand that this is hardly testing the code, and rather just an easy sanity check compared to what we expect for later homework and projects.</p>
<h2 id="Submit-your-work-for-Part-1"><a href="#Submit-your-work-for-Part-1" class="headerlink" title="Submit your work for Part 1"></a>Submit your work for Part 1</h2><p>We’re ready for the final step, submitting the completed work.  To do this, go to Gradescope (and log in) and navigate to the site’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/490535">CSCI 121 Spring 2023 course</a> page. You should see several assignments there, including one called <strong>[HW1 P1] survey</strong> and another called <strong>[HW1 P2] code</strong>.  When you click on each, you’ll get a <em>Submit Programming Assignment</em> pop-up that will ask you to upload the file you need to submit for that problem. For “code”, upload the file <code>code.py</code>, but only once you’ve run it yourself.  For “survey” upload the file <code>survey.txt</code>, but only once you’ve edited and saved it with your survey responses. For each, the system should tell you that the problem was successfully submitted.</p>
<p>The system then inspects the document you submitted and does work to give you more detailed feedback on its contents. In the case of the first problem, your submitted survey will get scanned by a script. In the case of the second problem, the code you submit will be run by a test script. For each, some results should appear shortly and a score out of 20 will get reported. Sometimes the system is slow but the score should eventually appear. Let us know if for some reason it does not.</p>
<p>If you see an autograder score of 20 for each, you will have completed Part 1 of this assignment. Congrats! You’re ready to do more interesting things in Part 2.</p>
<h1 id="Part-2-Some-Scripting"><a href="#Part-2-Some-Scripting" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Some Scripting"></a>Part 2: Some Scripting</h1><p>In the lectures we covered some key elements of the Python language. We showed examples of some simple Python <em>interactive scripts</em> that can be run in the terminal.  Python allows your program to read what’s entered into the terminal (using <code>input</code>) and to report computed values (using <code>print</code>).  In this Part 2 we write a couple scripts, test them to see that they work, and then submit them to Gradescope.</p>
<p>Below, for example, is a short three-line script that performs temperature unit conversion, getting a temperature in degrees celsius, then reporting the equivalent in degrees fahrenheit:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">c = <span class="built_in">float</span>(<span class="built_in">input</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Temperature in degrees celsius? &quot;</span>))</span><br><span class="line">f = (c * <span class="number">9.0</span> / <span class="number">5.0</span>) + <span class="number">32.0</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(f)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Running the code, we see that <code>input</code> produces a prompt, then waits for the user to enter a value. Python reads their entry as a string of characters, and so we use <code>float</code> to convert those characters to a floating-point numeric value.  The second line, a variable assignment to <code>f</code> using the value <code>c</code>, computes the floating point value according to that calculation. The value of variable <code>f</code> gets printed because of the last line of the script.</p>
<p>Here’s what happens in Terminal when we run that code using the <code>python3</code> command and, say, enter <code>100.0</code>:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">jimfix@C02MX1KLFH04:homework1 jimfix$ python3 temperature.py</span><br><span class="line">Temperature in degrees celsius? 100.0</span><br><span class="line">212.0</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>It’s possible to make the output of <code>print</code> more readable by including other text in that line of output. To do this, we can explictly convert the temperature value to a string of characters using the <code>str</code> conversion function and then append strings around that formatted information. We append strings using the <code>+</code> operator. For example, if we change the last line of the code above to</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">c = <span class="built_in">float</span>(<span class="built_in">input</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Temperature in degrees celsius? &quot;</span>))</span><br><span class="line">f = (c * <span class="number">9.0</span> / <span class="number">5.0</span>) + <span class="number">32.0</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;That is &quot;</span> + <span class="built_in">str</span>(f) + <span class="string">&quot; in degrees fahrenheit.&quot;</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>it leads to this interaction</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">jimfix@C02MX1KLFH04:homework1 jimfix$ python3 temperature.py</span><br><span class="line">Temperature in degrees celsius? 100.0</span><br><span class="line">That is 212.0 in degrees fahrenheit.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Note the spaces that we used to separate the number from the other text of the sentence.</p>
<p>Each of the exercises below asks you to write a Python script similar to the one above. Each program you write takes an input, or a series of inputs.  It then performs calculations on that input data and produces a formatted output of those calculations’ results. We first ask you to work with strings alone. You then work with integer and floating point values. For these you’ll want to convert input strings into numbers using the <code>int</code> and <code>float</code> functions.</p>
<h2 id="Submission-and-Autograding"><a href="#Submission-and-Autograding" class="headerlink" title="Submission and Autograding"></a>Submission and Autograding</h2><p>You should run your scripts several times, and with different inputs, to make sure that your code is working. Once you have reasonable confidence that it is working, submit it at the appropriate assignment link on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/490535">the Gradescope site for this course</a>.</p>
<p>When you upload the file for that problem on Gradescope we’ll immediately run a series of tests on that code to see if it is correct. Within a minute or so, you’ll get feedback from our <code>aga</code> Gradescope autograder” as a series of messages. If all these tests pass, then these messages will be green. Any failed tests will give a red message, and usually with some extra information underneath that can help you figure out what we found wrong with the code.</p>
<p>Our ability to give feedback in this way is limited, so you should seek help from your instructor or a tutor to help you explain what went wrong, and to help you think about fixing the problem. On some rare occasions some of you may face something that’s wrong with our set-up so it’s helpful to reach out to us if you are confused by the autograder’s report. There will be those moments when there’s something we didn’t anticipate in your submission, hopefully rarely.</p>
<p>Do not use Gradescope to test your code. Instead run the code yourself using Python’s interpreter and only submit once you’re convinced that the code is correct. If you fail some of our tests that should give you some pause. Take a moment to carefully look through your code and fix it, and then run some of your own tests before submitting it again. Don’t just make a quick change, cross your fingers, and submit it again.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each problem is worth 30 points. 20 of those points are assigned by the aga auto-grader, and the remaining 10 will be assigned later by one of us.</p>
<p>The auto-graded score is determined by some thoughtful test inputs that we’ve devised to check different scenarios. Our use of automated testing is meant to mimic real-world software coding, where a programmer’s code has to work in practice, sometimes facing unanticipated but perfectly reasonable scenarios.</p>
<p>The hand-graded score reflects our sense of your coding. Was it clear and succinct? Or did it do something unusual just to get the tests to pass? When we get to more complicated coding, these points will help us give feedback on code “style.” Making complicated code human-readable and human-understandable is often as important as whether the code works, especially for larger coding projects.</p>
<p>We split the auto-graded score into two components. We give points for passing some of the tests. This helps us to at least see the progress you’ve made in tackling the problem. This will be especially valuable for later assignments when you’ve figured out most of the problem but maybe haven’t considered some tricky “edge cases” yet.</p>
<p>The auto-grader also awards a “prize” component with its scoring. To get this prize, your code has to pass all the tests by the assignment deadline, and without too many attempts. If you submit answers for a single problem several times, with only incremental fixes, you get fewer prize points than if you test your code on your own, anticipate all the different cases, and get it working, say, on your first or second submission.</p>
<p>Both the test score and the hand-graded score allow us to reward you for figuring out most, if not all, of the problem’s puzzle. And the hand-grading allows us to give feedback on the quality of your code. The prize score is an additional incentive that encourages you to work on assignments in a timely fashion and to carefully test your code rather than just blindly submit it with little thought.</p>
<p>In summary here is how we score your work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>test score:</strong> <em>(automated)</em> partial or full credit for passing tests</li>
<li><strong>style score:</strong> <em>(by hand)</em> partial or full credit for clear, succinct, readable code; and for good attempts that maybe miss some cases</li>
<li><strong>prize score:</strong> <em>(automated)</em> credit for passing all tests on time, discounted if you submit too often because you didn’t anticipate some test cases</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Problems-for-Part-2"><a href="#Problems-for-Part-2" class="headerlink" title="Problems for Part 2"></a>Problems for Part 2</h2><p>• <strong>[HW1 P3] hal</strong></p>
<p>In the science fiction movie <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, the artificial intelligence of the <code>HAL 9000</code> computer, when commanded to do something, tells the main astronaut character:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">I&#x27;m sorry, Dave. I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t do that.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Write a Python script <code>hal.py</code> that replicates this interaction.  It should prompt for a name to be entered, and then take a string as input.  It should then prompt for an action it should take, and then take a second string as input.</p>
<p>Having obtained those two input strings, your program should then output a contrarian’s reply using that name, and then report that the action was not taken. Here, for example, is a transcript from a terminal execution of the command <code>python3 hal.py</code>:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">What is your name? Dave</span><br><span class="line">Ok. Now enter an action: Open the pod bay doors.</span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">I&#x27;m sorry, Dave. I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t do that.</span><br><span class="line">(The action &quot;Open the pod bay doors.&quot; was not performed.)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>In that example, the first two lines are each a combination of a printed prompt (each ending with a space character) followed by the characters entered by the person running the program. Here, they entered <code>Dave</code> and hit the <code>[return]</code> key and then <code>Open the pod bay doors.</code> followed by the <code>[return]</code> key.</p>
<p>After these two entries, a blank line and then the next two lines are printed by the script.</p>
<p>Here is another example of an expected interaction with your program when run:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">What is your name? stanley kubrick</span><br><span class="line">Ok. Now enter an action: cut!!!</span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">I&#x27;m sorry, stanley kubrick. I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t do that.</span><br><span class="line">(The action &quot;cut!!!&quot; was not performed.)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Your program’s interactions must <em>exactly</em> mimic the examples above.  There should be a space between each prompt and the program user’s input. There should be one space before the name and a period immediately following it.  There should be a double quote character just before and just after the action. Note that, even though the document you are reading (this one here) might make it appear so, there should be no spaces at the start of each line.  The lines are each left justified.</p>
<p>Note that you can output a blank line with the python statement</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">print()</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>that is, by giving <code>print</code> no argument within the parentheses.</p>
<p>Do your best to test your code and check the output, comparing it with our expected output. Be wary of your spacing before you submit.  The interaction’s transcript is in a fixed-width (i.e. monospaced or “typewriter”) font, so each character, including spaces, appears in its own column. This means that the output characters can be seen to line up within a grid as depicted below:</p>
<p><img src="/121-S23/2023/01/11/hw1/hal-grid.gif" alt="*Figure.* Gridding of terminal output."></p>
<p>Now, with all that being said, get that AI working!  (Or, I suppose, get it <em>not working</em>— HAL is <em>stubborn</em> and unwilling to do anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
<p>A big issue here is that there are two ways to describe a string of characters in Python. For example printing a <code>Hello.</code> line can be expressed in a program as</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">print(&quot;Hello.&quot;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>using double quotes around the string of characters and also instead using single quotes with</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">print(&#x27;Hello.&#x27;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>But this means that the single quote character <code>&#39;</code> and the double quote character <code>&quot;</code> have special meaning in this code. So, for example, you have to do extra work if you literally want a quote within a string.  For example, <code>Don&#39;t.</code> could be expressed in two ways:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">print(&quot;Don&#x27;t.&quot;)</span><br><span class="line">print(&#x27;Don\&#x27;t.&#x27;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The second form uses the “escape” backslash character <code>\ </code> to alert Python that a special character is coming next. So we read <code>\&#39;</code> as “escape to quote” There is also <code>\\ </code> for “escape to backslash”, <code>\t</code> for “escape to tab”, and <code>\n</code> for embedding an escaped request to start a new line within the middle string.</p>
<hr>
<p>• <strong>[HW1 P4] temperature</strong></p>
<p>I’ve written a simple interactive script, downloadable <a href="./temperature.py"><strong>as this linked file</strong></a> called <code>temperature.py</code> that requests an input, a numeric value that will be treated as a temperature in degrees celsius. The program, after that amount is entered, reports the equivalent temperature in degrees fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Here is the Python code for that program:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">c = <span class="built_in">float</span>(<span class="built_in">input</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Temperature in degrees celsius? &quot;</span>))</span><br><span class="line">f = (c * <span class="number">9.0</span> / <span class="number">5.0</span>) + <span class="number">32.0</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;That is &quot;</span>+<span class="built_in">str</span>(f)+<span class="string">&quot; in degrees fahrenheit.&quot;</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>And here is an example of its execution in terminal:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">C02MX1KLFH04:homework1 jimfix$ python3 temperature.py </span><br><span class="line">Temperature in degrees celsius? 40.5</span><br><span class="line">That is 104.9 in degrees fahrenheit.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The program takes a string as input and, assuming that its user types in a valid number, converts that string to a floating point value (with the <code>float(•)</code> conversion we described in lecture). It uses the variable <code>c</code> to store that value. It then assigns the variable <code>f</code> to the appropriate number of degrees, according to the celsius-to-fahrenheit formula. It then outputs that amount, but has to do so by converting the floating point value held in <code>f</code> to a string (with the <code>str(•)</code> conversion we also described in lecture).</p>
<p>Modify the code so that it instead asks for a temperature in degrees fahrenheit and reports the equivalent in degrees celsius.  Your program should lead to interactions like this one:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">C02MX1KLFH04:homework1 jimfix$ python3 temperature.py </span><br><span class="line">Temperature in degrees fahrenheit? 104.9</span><br><span class="line">That is 40.5 in degrees celsius.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Just like in the first exercise, you should get the spacing exactly right before you submit your code.</p>

<p>• <strong>[HW1 P5] distance</strong></p>
<p>We’re writing a new app that allows people in Portland to find where they are relative to Reed’s campus, one that presents a map to the app’s user.  The center of Eliot Circle is the origin of the map.  When a person is walking around, the app gives a two-dimensional coordinate of their location, $(x,y)$, giving them a position within a grid laid over the map.  The $x$ coordinate indicates how many miles east of Eliot Circle they are. The $y$ cordinate indicates how many miles north of Eliot Circle they are.</p>
<p>At any moment, the app tells them their distance from Eliot Circle, and that is computed (using the Pythagorean Theorem) to be</p>
<p>$$\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$</p>
<p>that is, the square root of the sum of the square of the distance east with the square of the distance north.</p>
<p>We want to enhance the app so that it allows a student to figure out their distance from a classroom. If they are located at $(x_1,y_1)$ and the classroom is located at $(x_2,y_2)$, then their distance from that classroom is</p>
<p>$$\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$</p>
<p>Write a Python script <code>distance.py</code> that allows you to experiment with this distance calculation. It should take the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of one location, and then the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of a second location. It should then report the distance using the above calculation.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Location x-coordinate? 3.2</span><br><span class="line">Location y-coordinate? 1.5</span><br><span class="line">Classroom x-coordinate? 6.2</span><br><span class="line">Classroom y-coordinate? -2.5</span><br><span class="line">Distance:</span><br><span class="line">5.0</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Note that you can compute the square root by using the exponentiation operator <code>**</code> and with an exponent of <code>0.5</code>. It’s also possible to <code>import</code> Python’s <code>math</code> package which defines a function <code>sqrt</code>.  Either is fine, one requires that you practice using <code>import</code>.  To import, put this line at the very top of the code, before the script that does the work:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">from</span> math <span class="keyword">import</span> sqrt</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>and then any code below that line will know about the function <code>sqrt</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p>• <strong>[HW1 P6] marquee</strong></p>
<p>Write a Python program <code>marquee.py</code> that attempts to mimic movie theater marquee signs, putting a word “<em>in lights</em>“.  To get an idea of what we want, below is an execution of the program:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Word? hello</span><br><span class="line">    	</span><br><span class="line">*********</span><br><span class="line">* hello *</span><br><span class="line">*********</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The first line is the input prompt, along with an entry of the word <code>hello</code>.  The second output line is just a blank line. The next three lines show the word decorated with surrounding asterisks.</p>
<p>Here is a second interaction:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Word? The Big Lebowski</span><br><span class="line">   	</span><br><span class="line">********************</span><br><span class="line">* The Big Lebowski *</span><br><span class="line">********************</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>To do this you need to use some string operations. We’ve been using string concatenation, designated with the <code>+</code> plus sign above.  Recall also that the <code>*</code> asterisk can be used for string repetition. For example, the expression <code>&#39;hi&#39;*5</code> means <code>&#39;hihihihihi&#39;</code>.  Here are some other examples of string repetition in Python:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="string">&#x27;hi&#x27;</span>*<span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">&#x27;hihi&#x27;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="string">&#x27;hi&#x27;</span>*<span class="number">0</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">&#x27;&#x27;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="string">&#x27;hello &#x27;</span> + (<span class="string">&#x27;hey &#x27;</span> * <span class="number">3</span>) + <span class="string">&#x27;bye&#x27;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">&#x27;hello hey hey hey bye&#x27;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The other string operation you need is a function that computes the length of a string, <code>len</code>. It gives the number of characters in the string’s sequence.  Here are some example uses of <code>len</code>:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; len(&#x27;hello&#x27;)</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; len(&#x27;Hello, I must be going.&#x27;)</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Note that it counts each space, each letter, and each punctuation mark laid out between the quotes.  </p>
<p>String concatenation, repetition, and length should be enough tools needed to make <code>marquee.py</code>.</p>
<h1 id="Appendices"><a href="#Appendices" class="headerlink" title="Appendices"></a>Appendices</h1><h2 id="Appendix-configuring-Atom-tabbing"><a href="#Appendix-configuring-Atom-tabbing" class="headerlink" title="Appendix: configuring Atom tabbing"></a>Appendix: configuring Atom tabbing</h2><p>You can configure <strong>Atom</strong> to use spaces by going to the menu bar at the top of the screen and finding the menu selection <em>Atom &gt; Preferences…</em>. This will bring up a <em>Settings</em> pane with an option list <em>Core</em>, <em>Editor</em>, etc. Select <em>Editor</em> and scroll through the various configurable options scanning for a check-box named <em>Soft Tabs</em>. Select this option with a check mark so that “soft tabs” are enabled. “Soft” means that when you hit the <code>[tab]</code> key a number of spaces will be entered instead. (“Hard” would mean that an actual tab is inserted.)</p>
<p>You should also change the <em>Tab Length</em> setting (just a little below the soft tabs setting). Set its field to <code>4</code>. <strong>Atom</strong> can be clever in reading source code that was written using different settings. It is willing to work with both hard tabs and soft tabs, mimicking the file it is reading. If you set the option <em>Tab Type</em> to <code>soft</code>, then it will just always insert spaces when you hit <code>[tab]</code> regardless of the other sections of the code. This is probably the option you should prefer.</p>
<h2 id="Appendix-getting-a-Windows-terminal-using-Git-tools"><a href="#Appendix-getting-a-Windows-terminal-using-Git-tools" class="headerlink" title="Appendix: getting a Windows terminal using Git tools"></a>Appendix: getting a Windows terminal using Git tools</h2><p>A different option for getting a terminal on Windows that has worked for CSCI 121 students in the past is to download and install a program provided by the GitHub service, as part of its Windows tools, called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gitforwindows.org/">GitBash</a>.  If you can get this installed, it works the same as the terminal programs on the Mac and on Linux.</p>
<h2 id="Appendix-getting-a-Windows-terminal-using-WSL"><a href="#Appendix-getting-a-Windows-terminal-using-WSL" class="headerlink" title="Appendix: getting a Windows terminal using WSL"></a>Appendix: getting a Windows terminal using WSL</h2><p>A fairly advanced option for getting a terminal on Windows is one used by students taking our CSCI 221 course. You can install a <strong>Windows System for Linux</strong> or <strong>WSL2</strong> on Windows. (The current version is 2.) A WSL is a bit more feature-rich than Powershell and GitBash (described just above). It essentially has you put a mini Unix computer system (sometimes called a “virtual machine”) onto your computer. This will be especially useful after this course, as you’ll probably see need to use other Unix tools beyond those for Python programming, and the skills you’ve learned in this class will probably motivate you to do so.</p>
<p>To install a WSL open up the <strong>Microsoft Store</strong> and search for <strong>Linux</strong>. This will bring up several Linux distributions as applications that you can download. Select the <strong>Ubuntu</strong> one and install it. Alternatively, you can probably just search directly for “Ubuntu” in the store.</p>
<p>Once you’ve downloaded that software application, go ahead and run it.  Running the Ubuntu WSL brings up a Unix console window, one that will (because it is your first time running it) ask you to name your WSL user and provide its password. I recommend using your Reed login name and password here, but you can choose whatever you like. This username&#x2F;password combo will be what you type in every time you run this Ubuntu WSL application.</p>
<p>Because this acts like a computer within your computer, it acts like it has its own structure of files and folders. But you can access your normal Windows system files and folders (the stuff that’s normally on your <code>C:</code> drive) using a special “folder path” here within WSL.  For example if you type the command</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">cd /mnt/c/Users/WINDOWS-NAME/csci121</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>where <code>WINDOWS-NAME</code> is your Windows user name, this will take you into the folder we had you make with the “<strong>Make coursework folders</strong>“ step up above. If you don’t know your Windows user name, typing the command</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">ls /mnt/c/Users</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>should give you a list of possible user names on the system, and it should hopefully be obvious which one is yours.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to create a shortcut to your coursework folder within this WSL subsystem. If you enter the commands</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">cd ~</span><br><span class="line">ln -s /mnt/c/Users/WINDOWS-NAME/csci121 csci121</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>then this will create a “symbolic link” called <code>csci121</code> in your WSL user’s home, and that is a system item that refers to the actual <code>csci121</code> folder in your Window’s user’s home.</p>
<p>This all sounds complicated, and it’s not necessary for this course.  Nevertheless, some of you might enjoy giving it a try.</p>
