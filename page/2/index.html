        <p><strong>Complete and submit by 3&#x2F;10 at 1:00pm</strong></p>
<p>This week’s lab exercises are a mix of problems that have you work with Python lists and with Python dictionaries. We ask you to write a function for each of them.</p>
<p>Let me just remind you that lists and dictionaries are both <em>passed by reference</em> to a function.  This means that it is possible to change the values stored in them, and to increase and decrease their size by applying certain operations to them, within a function’s code. These changes can be noticed by the client code that uses the function that changes them.</p>
<p>An example of this comes from lecture. We wrote the code for <code>rotate_right</code> as below</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">rotate_right</span>(<span class="params">xs</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="built_in">len</span>(xs) &gt; <span class="number">1</span>:</span><br><span class="line">        last = xs.pop()</span><br><span class="line">        xs.insert(<span class="number">0</span>,last)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The function does not return anything, but it takes the list <code>xs</code> and modifies it by performing a <code>pop</code> to remove the last value in the list, followed by an <code>insert</code> that puts that value at the front. Here it is in action:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; some_values = [11, 7, 17, -3, 5]</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; rotate_right(some_values)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; some_values</span><br><span class="line">[5, 11, 7, 17, -3]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Calling the function with a list has the effect of “rotating” the contents of the list it is passed.</p>
<p>Because of this ability to modify lists and dictionaries, you need to pay careful attention as to whether we want your function to change the data structure it is given, and also whether or not we want you to build and return a new data structure.</p>
<h1 id="Problems"><a href="#Problems" class="headerlink" title="Problems"></a>Problems</h1><h2 id="HW6-P1-make-even"><a href="#HW6-P1-make-even" class="headerlink" title="[HW6 P1] make even"></a><code>[HW6 P1]</code> make even</h2><p>Write a function <code>def make_even(xs)</code> that, when given a list of integers <code>xs</code>, modifies the elements of the list to make them all divisible by 2. If a list element is even, it should not be changed. If a list element is odd, it should be decremented by one. The <code>make_even</code> function should modify the list it is given, and not return a list back.  Have it return the value <code>None</code>, and have the list be modified as a <em>side effect</em> of being executed.  Here is an example of its behavior:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; ys = [1, 3, 2, -7, 0, -8, 11]</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; zs = [10, 0, 1, 1, -1, 100]</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; make_even(ys)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; make_even(zs)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; ys</span><br><span class="line">[0, 2, 2, -8, 0, -8, 10]</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; zs</span><br><span class="line">[10, 0, 0, 0, -2, 100]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h2 id="HW6-P2-remove-duplicates"><a href="#HW6-P2-remove-duplicates" class="headerlink" title="[HW6 P2] remove duplicates"></a><code>[HW6 P2]</code> remove duplicates</h2><p>Write a function <code>def remove_duplicates(xs)</code> that takes a list of integers and modifies it so that it has the same set of integer items, but with no items duplicated. For example: </p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; zs1 = [100, 0, 1, -1, 1, 100] </span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; remove_duplicates(zs1) </span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; zs1 [100, 0, 1, -1] </span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; zs2 = [100, 100, 100, 100] </span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; remove_duplicates(zs2) </span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; zs2 [100] </span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; zs3 = [] </span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; remove_duplicates(zs3) </span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; zs3 [] </span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The list that results should have the same ordering as the ordering of the first occurrences of each integer as they appeared before the duplicates were removed.</p>
<h2 id="HW6-P3-diagonal-table"><a href="#HW6-P3-diagonal-table" class="headerlink" title="[HW6 P3] diagonal table"></a><code>[HW6 P3]</code> diagonal table</h2><p>Below is a list of lists, where each list has the same length:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">[[1, 2, 0, 1], [5, 3, 1, 4], [8, 7, 1, 5]]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The “outer” list has three elememts in it, and each such element is a four-element list. If that list is called <code>table</code>, then accessing the list slot with the value 7 can be done with the notation</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">table[2][1]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>because it is held in the last of the three lists, and it is item 1 of that last list.</p>
<p>We can think of a lists of lists as a table.  Below I’ve laid out its contents to suggest its tabular form:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">[[1, 2, 0, 1],</span><br><span class="line"> [5, 3, 1, 4],</span><br><span class="line"> [8, 7, 1, 5]]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>It has three rows and four columns.  We see that 7 is in row number 2 (the top row is row 0), and in column 1 (the left column is column 0). In general, we can access the item in row <code>r</code> and column <code>c</code> with the notation</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">table[r][c]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Write a function <code>def diagonal_table(size)</code> that, when given a positive integer <code>size</code>, returns a list of lists that is a table with the same number of rows and columns in it, with each dimension of length <code>size</code>. It should be full of 0s, excepting that all the entries along the table’s diagonal have the value 1. For example</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; t = diagonal_table(4)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; t</span><br><span class="line">[[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Laying the result out as a table, we get</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">[[1, 0, 0, 0],</span><br><span class="line"> [0, 1, 0, 0],</span><br><span class="line"> [0, 0, 1, 0],</span><br><span class="line"> [0, 0, 0, 1]]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Note that all the non-zero entries are <code>t[i][i]</code>, all the locations where the row number <code>i</code> is the same as the column number <code>i</code>.</p>
<h2 id="HW6-P4-word-count"><a href="#HW6-P4-word-count" class="headerlink" title="[HW6 P4] word count"></a><code>[HW6 P4]</code> word count</h2><p>A Python string made up of words separated by spaces can be split into a list of strings made up of the words as they were strung together. To do so, you use a string operation called <code>split</code>, passing it the space character <code>&#39; &#39;</code> like so:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; sentence = &quot;the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs&quot;</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; print(sentence)</span><br><span class="line">the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; words = sentence.split(&#x27; &#x27;)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; words</span><br><span class="line">[&#x27;the&#x27;, &#x27;quick&#x27;, &#x27;brown&#x27;, &#x27;fox&#x27;, &#x27;jumped&#x27;, &#x27;over&#x27;, &#x27;the&#x27;, &#x27;lazy&#x27;, &#x27;dogs&#x27;]</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;hello there&quot;.split(&#x27; &#x27;)</span><br><span class="line">[&#x27;hello&#x27;, &#x27;there&#x27;]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Write a function <code>def word_count(s)</code> that takes a string <code>s</code> and gives back a dictionary that gives an integer count of the number of times each word appears in <code>s</code>. There should be a dictionary entry for every word that appears in <code>s</code> and each should have a value of 1 or more that corresponds to the number of times that word appears.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; word_count(&quot;hello there&quot;)</span><br><span class="line">&#123;&#x27;hello&#x27;:1, &#x27;there&#x27;:1&#125;</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; word_count(&quot;buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo&quot;)</span><br><span class="line">&#123;&#x27;buffalo&#x27;:8&#125;</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; word_count(&quot;b a n a n a s&quot;)</span><br><span class="line">&#123;&#x27;a&#x27;: 3, &#x27;b&#x27;:1, &#x27;n&#x27;:2, &#x27;s&#x27;:1&#125;</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; word_count(&quot;i am who i am as far as i know&quot;)</span><br><span class="line">&#123;&#x27;as&#x27;:2, &#x27;am&#x27;:2, &#x27;far&#x27;:1, &#x27;i&#x27;:3, &#x27;know&#x27;:1, &#x27;who&#x27;:1&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You can assume that the string consists of only the letters from <code>&#39;a&#39;</code> to <code>&#39;z&#39;</code> and spaces, that there are no spaces at the front or end of the string, and that there are never two consecutive spaces.</p>
<p>Note that the ordering of dictionary entries produced by Python’s report does not matter. Dictionary entries, unlike list entires, are unordered. This means that</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; word_count(&quot;hello there&quot;)</span><br><span class="line">&#123;&#x27;there&#x27;:1, &#x27;hello&#x27;:1&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>is just as correct a result as the result listed before.</p>
<h2 id="HW6-P5-replace-using"><a href="#HW6-P5-replace-using" class="headerlink" title="[HW6 P5] replace using"></a><code>[HW6 P5]</code> replace using</h2><p>A list of strings can be joined together into a single string by using the string <code>join</code> operation as shown below</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; words = [&#x27;the&#x27;, &#x27;quick&#x27;, &#x27;brown&#x27;, &#x27;fox&#x27;, &#x27;jumped&#x27;, &#x27;over&#x27;, &#x27;the&#x27;, &#x27;lazy&#x27;, &#x27;dogs&#x27;]</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; sentence = &#x27; &#x27;.join(words)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; sentence</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs&#x27;</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; &#x27; &#x27;.join([&#x27;ba&#x27;,&#x27;nan&#x27;,&#x27;a&#x27;,&#x27;s&#x27;])</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;ba nan a s&#x27;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Write a function <code>def replace_using(s,d)</code> that takes a string <code>s</code> that is a space-separated string of words like in problem <code>[HW6 P4]</code>. It also takes a dictionary of word substitutions. It returns the string that results from applying the replacements in <code>d</code> to the string <code>s</code>.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; replace_using(&quot;i am who i am as far as i know&quot;, &#123;&#x27;i&#x27;:&#x27;am&#x27;,&#x27;am&#x27;:&#x27;was&#x27;,&#x27;know&#x27;:&#x27;now&#x27;&#125;)</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;am was who am was as far as am now&#x27;</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; replace_using(&quot;i am who i am as far as i know&quot;, &#123;&#x27;i&#x27;:&#x27;as&#x27;, &#x27;as&#x27;:&#x27;yass&#x27;&#125;)</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;as am who as am yass far yass as know&#x27;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Notice that the replacement occurs as a result of one pass through the string.  In the second example, we replaced each <code>&#39;i&#39;</code> in the original string with <code>&#39;as&#39;</code> and we replaced each <code>&#39;as&#39;</code> in the original string with <code>&#39;yass&#39;</code>. We didn’t then replace the <code>&#39;as&#39;</code> words that were placed by that one pass with any <code>&#39;yass&#39;</code> words with some second pass.</p>
<p>You can assume that the entry words and their replacements are made up of one or more of the letters from <code>&#39;a&#39;</code> to <code>&#39;z&#39;</code>.</p>
<h2 id="HW6-P6-inverse"><a href="#HW6-P6-inverse" class="headerlink" title="[HW6 P6] inverse"></a><code>[HW6 P6]</code> inverse</h2><p>Write a function <code>def inverse(d)</code> which takes a dictionary <code>d</code> and returns its “inverse” dictionary, a dictionary mapping values of entries in the given dictionary to lists of keys in the given dictionary. The keys of the dictionary it returns are the the values of the original dictionary and whose entries are lists of keys which mapped to that value in the original dictionary. For example:</p>

<p>Note that the ordering of dictionary entries produced by Python’s report does not matter. Dictionary entries, unlike list entires, are unordered. This means that</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; inverse(&#123;&#x27;a&#x27;:&#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27;:&#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;cats&#x27;:&#x27;rest&#x27;, &#x27;world&#x27;:&#x27;hello&#x27;&#125;)</span><br><span class="line">&#123;&#x27;b&#x27;:[&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27;], &#x27;hello&#x27;:[&#x27;world&#x27;], &#x27;rest&#x27;:[&#x27;cats&#x27;]&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>is just as correct a result as the result listed before.</p>
<p>The ordering of the listed values in the inverse dictionary also does not matter.  That means that the entry for <code>&#39;b&#39;</code> could instead have been <code>[&#39;c&#39;, &#39;a&#39;]</code> in the result reported just above.</p>

<p>This week we again ask you to write a function for each of the homework exercises.  For some of these you might sometimes find it useful to write other “helper” functions. These can be used by the primary function you are asked to write.  It’s not necessary to do this, but it can sometimes make your problem-solving and your testing easier.</p>
<p>All the required functions act on Pytgon lists, a <em>mutable, reference-based</em> data structure for storing collections of values. Lists (like <code>[4,1,2,1,1,3]</code>) hold sequences of values, and might have repeated elements.</p>
<p>Since lists are <em>passed by reference</em> to a function it is possible for a function to modify their contents, changing the values stored in them as a <em>side effect</em> of the function’s execution. When you write your code pay careful attention as to whether we want your function to change the list it is given, or instead whether we want you to build and return a new list (perhaps based on a list that you are given).</p>
<h1 id="Problems"><a href="#Problems" class="headerlink" title="Problems"></a>Problems</h1><h2 id="HW5-P1-down-up"><a href="#HW5-P1-down-up" class="headerlink" title="[HW5 P1] down up"></a><code>[HW5 P1]</code> down up</h2><p>Write a function <code>def down_up(n)</code> that, when given a positive integer <code>n</code>, returns a list that contains a palindrome of counts as shown here:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; down_up(3)</span><br><span class="line">[3, 2, 1, 2, 3]</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; down_up(5)</span><br><span class="line">[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; down_up(1)</span><br><span class="line">[1]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>That is, the returned list’s values should run from <code>n</code> down to 1, then back up to <code>n</code>.</p>

<p>Note that the list could be empty. In that case, the function should return a sum of 0.</p>
<h2 id="HW5-P3-counts"><a href="#HW5-P3-counts" class="headerlink" title="[HW5 P3] counts"></a><code>[HW5 P3]</code> counts</h2><p>Write a function <code>def counts(n,xs)</code> that when given a positive integer <code>n</code> and a list of integers <code>xs</code>, one whose elements are known to be non-negative integers less than <code>n</code>, builds and returns a list that contains the number of occurrences in <code>xs</code> of each of the values from <code>0</code> to <code>n-1</code>.  For example, we get this interaction</p>

<p>because <code>0</code> occurs twice, <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> each occur once, <code>5</code> occurs three times, and <code>3</code> and <code>4</code> don’t occur. Here are a few more example uses of <code>counts</code>:</p>

<p>In the last two homeworks we practiced using two kinds of Python constructs that allow a programmer to “<em>control the flow</em>“ of the interpreter’s execution of statements in your program. These were (1) the <code>if</code> statement that provides conditional execution and (2) the <code>def</code> statement that provides a means for defining functions to help compute values.</p>
<p>With <em>conditional statements</em>, the program might skip past some blocks of statements, or it may execute one block versus another, all depending on some condition that’s checked by that <code>if</code> statement.</p>
<p>With <em>function definitions</em>, a program can jump to a named section of code to perform some actions, or to compute some result, all towards serving the work of the main script. These <code>def</code> statements act as useful “modules” that serve the main script. The <em>function call mechanism</em> which requires the calling code to pass <em>parameter values</em> to the function, and then (possibly) get a value upon the function’s <code>return</code>, imposes a discipline that helps the programmer structuretheir code in a readable way. Each function definitions provides a reusable code component.</p>
<p>This week we practice using Python’s <code>while</code> statement for structuring code. A <code>while</code> statement provides <em>iteration</em>: the program can execute a <em>loop</em>. It can repeatedly perform a series of actions until some condition is met. For example, the code below counts from 1 to<br>10. It keeps printing then adding one to the variable <code>count</code> until<br>that variable gets larger than 10:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;I will now count from 1 to 10...&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line">count = <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">while</span> count &lt;= <span class="number">10</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;The count is now &quot;</span> + <span class="built_in">str</span>(count) + <span class="string">&quot;.&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    count = count + <span class="number">1</span> // Increments the count variable by <span class="number">1.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;There. I am done counting.&quot;</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Here is what that code does: After executing the first two lines, the program will execute the <code>print</code> and the increment statements inside the <code>while</code> statement’s <em>body</em>. This is because the <code>count</code> variable is only at <code>1</code>, and that value is less than or equal to 10.  After executing those two lines once, the interpreter “jumps” back to the condition line to see whether <code>count &lt;= 10</code>. Since the condition is still true (<code>count == 2</code> and <code>2 &lt;= 10</code>), it runs those two lines again and re-checks the condition. It keeps looping through those three code lines– checking the condition, printing, incrementing– until the assignment statement changes the value of <code>count</code> from <code>10</code> to <code>11</code>. When the loop condition is checked an 11-th time, the condition will then be <code>False</code>, and the program skips to the line below the loop body. It prints the message “<code>There. I am done counting.</code>“</p>
<p>The problems below ask you to write functions that each work in this way.  You will use a <code>while</code> loop (or loops) to do each function’s work.</p>
<h2 id="Submission-and-Scoring"><a href="#Submission-and-Scoring" class="headerlink" title="Submission and Scoring"></a>Submission and Scoring</h2><p>Submit each source file containing a Python function definition, possibly with some other “helper” functions, to the Gradescope site.  The problems below are labeled the way they will appear as submission items in Gradescope.  We’ll run tests on your submission to see if your code is correct. Before submitting, you should test your function on several scenarios, making sure it works with a good variety of parameters. Only submit it when you have reasonable confidence that it is correct.</p>
<p>Some of the problems allow you to assume that a function’s client code won’t feed the function certain kinds of parameter values. When we allow you to make assumptions like that, your code need not check for parameters that aren’t assumed to happen.</p>
<p>Each problem is worth 30 points. 10 of the points are awarded based on the number of tests you pass. An additional prize of up to 10 points will be awarded if <em>all</em> the tests pass by the due date.  You’ll earn fewer of these prize points if you have to submit a problem several times to get all the tests to pass.</p>
<p>Another 10 points will be offered after the deadline based on the quality of your code. You should look for straight-forward solutions to solve the puzzle, and your code should be clear and easy to understand.  In cases where you feel the need to do something complicated– some programming puzzles require tricky coding– you should include comments that (briefly) explain your code’s approach.</p>

<p>$$1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \cdots + n^3$$</p>
<p>So, for example, <code>sum_cubes(3)</code> should evaluate to <code>36</code> because it is the sum of the first three cubes $1 + 8 + 27$.  For values of <code>n</code> that are less than <code>1</code>, your function should return <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>Place your function definition in a file named <code>sum_cubes.py</code> and test it with different values in the Python interpreter before you submit the code.</p>

<p>because $4^2 &#x3D; 16 &lt; 21 &lt; 25 &#x3D; 5^2$. Negative numbers are not perfect squares.  Zero and one are perfect squares of themselves.</p>

<h2 id="HW4-P3-divisors"><a href="#HW4-P3-divisors" class="headerlink" title="[HW4 P3] divisors"></a><code>[HW4 P3]</code> divisors</h2><p>Write a function <code>def divisors(number)</code> that takes a positive integer and returns a report of all the positive integer divisors of that number.  That report should be in the form of a string that lists the divisors in order, starting with <code>1</code>.  If there are more than two divisors, it should use an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma">Oxford comma</a> before the mention of the last divisor.</p>
<p>Here is an example use of the function.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; divisors(35)</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;The divisors of 35 are 1, 5, 7, and 35.&#x27;</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; divisors(1)</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;The divisor of 1 is 1.&#x27;</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; divisors(2)</span><br><span class="line">&#x27;The divisors of 2 are 1 and 2.&#x27;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>It takes an integer and returns a string. <strong>The <code>divisors</code> function does not print anything.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong><br>Your function should seek to build a string by looping through all the possible divisors and appending them to that report string using the string concatenation operation <code>+</code>.  It then will want to append information to the front and back of that report. What it appends will depend on whether there is only one divisor, or two divisors, or more than two divisors.</p>
<p>Use integer division to figure out divisibility.</p>
<h2 id="HW4-P4-magnitude"><a href="#HW4-P4-magnitude" class="headerlink" title="[HW4 P4] magnitude"></a><code>[HW4 P4]</code> magnitude</h2><p>People often talk about the order of magnitude of an amount. In doing so, they are often thinking in terms of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0">powers of ten</a>.  Let’s instead give a very computer science-y definition of the <em>magnitude</em> of a number based on powers of two. The first seven powers of two are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. We’ll say that</p>
<ul>
<li>0 is of magnitude 0;</li>
<li>1 is of magnitude 1;</li>
<li>2 and 3 are of magnitude 2;</li>
<li>4, 5, 6, and 7 all are of magnitude 3;</li>
<li>the numbers from 8 to 15 are of magnitude 4;</li>
</ul>
<p>and so on. Note that 30 is of magnitude 5 because it is less than 32, and $32 &#x3D; 2^5$. But it is also that magnitude because dividing it by 2 yields 15, and 15 is magnitude 4. In other words, the number 30 has one more order of magnitude than 15 because it is twice as big, and because we have chosen to think in base two.</p>
<p>Write a function <code>magnitude</code> that returns the magnitude of a non-negative integer as we describe above. For example, your function’s code should work as follows:</p>

<p>You can assume <code>magnitude</code> is called only with numbers 0 or larger.</p>
<p><strong>Hint</strong>: The magnitude can be computed by counting the number of times you can divide by two until there is nothing left to divide.</p>
<p>You should not use any floating point operations to do this work. It turns out that the magnitude of a positive number is just the number of bits in its binary representation. Even so, you cannot use any Python-provided library functions that perform binary conversion.  You should instead compute this magnitude “from scratch” using integer division.</p>
<h2 id="HW4-P5-Euclid"><a href="#HW4-P5-Euclid" class="headerlink" title="[HW4 P5] Euclid"></a><code>[HW4 P5]</code> Euclid</h2><p>In the Western world, Euclid is often touted as the inventor of the first recorded algorithm. In Book VII of Euclid’s <em>Elements</em>, he lays out a description of determining whether two integers have a common divisor, or else are relatively prime. He writes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When two unequal numbers are set out, and the less is continually subtracted in turn from the greater, if the number which is left never measures the one before it until a unit is left, then the original numbers are relatively prime.</p>
<p>(See the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookVII/propVII1.html">Proposition</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He is describing an iterative process that starts with two positive integers.  If the two numbers are the same, then their common divisor is their whole self.  If instead one of the numbers is <code>1</code>– if it is “a unit”– then the process stops having determined that they have no common divisor. If the numbers differ and are both greater than <code>1</code>, then repeat the process using the smaller number of the pair along with the positive difference between the pair– the subtraction of the lesser from the greater.</p>
<p>Write a function <code>def euclid(a,b)</code> that performs Euclid’s algorithm to determine whether or not two positive numbers have a common divisor by performing this process.  For example, if the function is handed <code>15</code> and <code>24</code>, the process should repeat with <code>9</code> and <code>15</code> (because <code>9</code> equals <code>24 - 15</code>), and then <code>9</code> and <code>6</code>, and then <code>6</code> and <code>3</code>, and then <code>3</code> and <code>3</code>. Because these are equal, it stops and returns <code>True</code>. As another example, if the numbers it is given are <code>7</code> and <code>5</code>, then its process repeats with <code>5</code> and <code>2</code> (because <code>2</code> equals <code>7 - 5</code>), then with <code>3</code> and <code>2</code>, then <code>2</code> and <code>1</code>. Because one of these is <code>1</code> it then stops and returns <code>False</code>.</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>euclid(<span class="number">15</span>,<span class="number">24</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="literal">True</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>euclid(<span class="number">7</span>,<span class="number">5</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="literal">False</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Your function can assume that its two parameters are both greater than 1. You need not worry about handling other kinds of parameters.</p>
<h2 id="HW4-P6-reverse-number"><a href="#HW4-P6-reverse-number" class="headerlink" title="[HW4 P6] reverse number"></a><code>[HW4 P6]</code> reverse number</h2><p>The table below illustrates an iterative process for examining the digits of a number.  In particular, it computes the number whose decimal digits are the reverse of that number:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="right">number</th>
<th align="right">reverse</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td align="right">53137</td>
<td align="right">0</td>

<tr>
<td align="right">5313</td>
<td align="right">7</td>

<tr>
<td align="right">531</td>
<td align="right">73</td>

<tr>
<td align="right">53</td>
<td align="right">731</td>

<tr>
<td align="right">5</td>
<td align="right">7313</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="right">0</td>
<td align="right">73135</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The first row starts with a number and also 0.  Each subsequent row of the table advances a calculation on those two numbers that has the effect of changing their digits. The first column gives the result of the number above it when it is divided by 10. The second column is the number above it, multiplied by 10, and with the last digit “lost” from the first column because of the division by 10 added to it. For example, the row with <code>531</code> and <code>73</code> is followed by a row containing <code>53</code> and <code>731</code> because <code>53 == 531 // 10</code> and because <code>731 == 73*10 + 1</code>.</p>
<p>In this exercise, generalize your code for <strong>[HW2 P3]</strong> so that it computes the reverse as shown in the table.  Write the code as a function <code>def reverse_number(n)</code> instead of as a script. (Put the definition in a file named <code>reverse_number.py</code>.)  It should take a non-negative integer <code>n</code> as a parameter and it should return the integer whose digits are the reverse of the decimal representation of <code>n</code>.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; reverse_number(53137)</span><br><span class="line">73135</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; reverse_number(0)</span><br><span class="line">0</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; reverse_number(2112)</span><br><span class="line">2112</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; reverse_number(1234567)</span><br><span class="line">7654321</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Your code should use only integer operations. It should not use floating point, nor should it convert the integer to a string to obtain the decimal digits. Instead, I recommend writing code that mimics the caclulations shown in the table just above.</p>
<h2 id="HW4-P7-count-palindromes"><a href="#HW4-P7-count-palindromes" class="headerlink" title="[HW4 P7] count palindromes"></a><code>[HW4 P7]</code> count palindromes</h2><p>A number is a <em>decimal palindrome</em> whenever it reads the same forwards and backwards.  For example <code>747</code>, <code>2112</code>, <code>0</code>, and <code>1234567654321</code> are all decimal palindromes.</p>
<p>Write a procedure <code>def count_palindromes(limit)</code> that gives the numbers from 0 up to <code>limit</code> that are decimal palindromes. For example:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; count_palindromes(999)</span><br><span class="line">109</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; count_palindromes(1000)</span><br><span class="line">109</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; count_palindromes(1001)</span><br><span class="line">110</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; count_palindromes(77)</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; count_palindromes(10)</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The last result is <code>10</code> because the single-digit numbers 0 through 9 are all decimal palindromes. The next-to-last result is <code>17</code> because 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, and 77 are also decimal palindromes.</p>

<p>This week’s exercises each ask you to invent a Python <em>function</em>.  The Python file that you submit for each should contain that function’s definition using the <code>def</code> statement. We’ll talk more about this just below.  In short, they will not be interactive scripts. Instead, you will test your work by loading that definition’s file into the Python interpreter.  You’ll try out that function on a lot of different parameters, making sure that it returns the correct value in each case.</p>
<h2 id="On-Python-functions"><a href="#On-Python-functions" class="headerlink" title="On Python functions"></a>On Python functions</h2><p>This week we ask you to devise a Python function rather than a Python script. You’ll use the <code>def</code> statement to describe a function that computes and returns a value based on the values of the parameters that are passed to it.  For example, the fifth exercise has you write a function <code>stars</code>.  You’ll write code into a Python text file that includes a line</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">stars</span>(<span class="params">width, height</span>):</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Here, <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are the <em>formal parameters</em> that stand in for the <em>actual parameter</em> values sent to the function when it is used by other code. The lines after this <code>def</code> line describe the behavior of the function, <em>each line indented by 4 spaces</em>, ultimately <em>returning</em> a value that the function is asked to compute. (In the case of <code>stars</code>, the function will return a string of characters.)</p>
<p>Below, for example, is a function that performs temperature unit conversion, getting a temperature in degrees fahrenheit, then reporting the equivalent in degrees celsius:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">convert</span>(<span class="params">degrees_f</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    degrees_c = (degrees_f - <span class="number">32.0</span>) / <span class="number">9.0</span> * <span class="number">5.0</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> degrees_c</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Using this function’s code is a bit different than running a script’s code. We need to call the function in order to use its code. One way to test the code is to load the function definition into an <em>interactive</em> Python session, and then call the function with some parameters.  If, for example, we imagine that the <code>convert</code> function is defined in a source file <code>convert.py</code>, we could do the following:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H samples % python3 -i convert.py </span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; convert(212.0)</span><br><span class="line">100.0</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; convert(32.0)</span><br><span class="line">0.0</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; convert(-40.0)</span><br><span class="line">-40.0</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Here, because we ran the Python command with <code>-i</code>, the code was loaded <em>interactively</em>, and we are able to test the function within the Python interpreter.</p>
<p>When an exercise asks you to write a single function, it is more than okay to define <em>other</em> functions in the same <code>.py</code> file, ones that you use to help you compute the value expected for that one specified function. Indeed, writing these <em>helper functions</em> can sometimes be a great way to structure your code, especially since it allows you to test portions of your work—to get those subcomponents working—as you construct the function they serve.</p>
<p>For many of these functions you’ll want to use <code>if</code> statements to do their calculations. Also, you want to <code>return</code> the computed results rather than use <code>print</code> statements.  Functions return values.</p>
<h2 id="Submission-and-Autograding"><a href="#Submission-and-Autograding" class="headerlink" title="Submission and Autograding"></a>Submission and Autograding</h2><p>Submit each Python source file containing your script code to the Gradescope site. The problems below are labeled the way they will appear as submission items in Gradescope.  As before, we’ll run a series of tests on a problem submission to see if your code is correct. The autograder will your scripts, trying out different input strings. It checks to see whether the lines output by <code>print</code> match what we expect. Before submitting, you should run your scripts several times, and with different inputs, to make sure that your code is working. Only submit it when you have reasonable confidence that it is correct.</p>
<p>It’s hard to anticipate every possible input, but you should work to anticipate as much as you can.</p>
<p>Some of the problems allow you to assume that a user won’t enter certain kinds of inputs. When we allow you to make assumptions like that, you do not need to check inputs that aren’t assumed to happen.</p>
<h2 id="Scoring"><a href="#Scoring" class="headerlink" title="Scoring"></a>Scoring</h2><p>Each problem is worth 30 points. 10 of the points are awarded based on the number of tests you pass. An additional prize of up to 10 points will be awarded if <em>all</em> the tests pass by the due date.  You’ll earn fewer of these prize points if you have to submit a problem several times to get all the tests to pass. Another 10 points will be given after the deadline as a result of our own assessment of the quality of your code.</p>

<h1 id="Problems"><a href="#Problems" class="headerlink" title="Problems"></a>Problems</h1><h2 id="HW3-P1-feet-to-meters"><a href="#HW3-P1-feet-to-meters" class="headerlink" title="[HW3 P1] feet to meters"></a><code>[HW3 P1]</code> feet to meters</h2><p>There are three feet in a yard and a yard is equal to 0.9144 meters. In a file called <code>feet_to_meters.py</code> define a function <code>feet_to_meters</code> that takes a value that represents a length in feet.  The function should calculate and return a value that is the equivalent length in meters. It should calculate this conversion using floating point numbers.</p>
<p>This means that this is the kind of code you should expect to write in<br><code>feet_to_meters.py</code>:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">feet_to_meters</span>(<span class="params">f</span>):</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Here, we are using <code>f</code> to represent a number that gets fed to the <code>feet_to_meters</code> function.  In the lines that follow you should have a line of code, or maybe several lines of code, that perform the conversion calculation. That code should work for any floating point value of <code>f</code>. Again that code should be <em>indented</em> and should ultimately <code>return</code> the value it calulates. It shouldn’t contain any <code>print</code> or <code>input</code> statements within its definition.</p>
<p>Here is an example test of that function within the Python interpreter:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H homework3 % python3 -i feet_to_meters.py </span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; feet_to_meters(10.0)</span><br><span class="line">3.048</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Note that, because of the nature of floating point, it is possible to get a <em>slightly</em> different result than the output above. That could happen because you used a different formula than we did.  When you submit your code our tests will tolerate slight differences in the numeric value, but will not tolerate significant differences.</p>
<p>Let me once again point out that your <code>feet_to_meters</code> function should <em>return</em> the converted value rather than <em>output</em> it using <code>print</code>. Printing values is very different than returning values. Ask us about this if you are unclear about this distinction.  Some of our testing won’t allow printing to happen within a function’s code.</p>
<h2 id="HW3-P2-coins"><a href="#HW3-P2-coins" class="headerlink" title="[HW3 P2] coins"></a><code>[HW3 P2]</code> coins</h2><p>In a file <code>coins.py</code>, write a function <code>coins</code> that, when given a number of cents, prints the number of US coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies) needed to make that amount. For example it should run like so</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H homework3 % python3 -i coins.py </span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>coins(<span class="number">11</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">2</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>because only two coins, a dime and a penny, are needed to make change of 11 cents.  Here are a few more examples:</p>

<p>All numbers other than 1, 2, and 3 should have a suffix of <code>th</code>, including 0. This means that your function should have this behavior:</p>

<p>Write a function <code>cheapest</code> that takes as input the number of boxes a customer has and returns a string equal to the name of the person whose company would be cheaper. If the two companies would charge the same amount, have the function choose Alice’s over Bob’s.</p>
<p>For example, <code>cheapest(25)</code> returns <code>&#39;Bob&#39;</code> because Alice would charge 600 dollars (three trips) and Bob would charge 500 dollars (two trips), and so Bob charges less in that case.</p>

These are named lines of code that take parameters.  But they <em>do something</em> rather than return a value. For example, here is a procedure that outputs <code>odd</code> or <code>even</code> depending on the value of its parameter <code>number</code>:</p>

<p>You can assume the integer <code>number</code> is positive and less than 1000.</p>

<p>In this second homework we write a few more interactive scripts.  Some of these just rely on what you learned to complete Homework 1.  We’re giving you more practice with integer and string calculations, with <code>input</code>, and with <code>print</code>. Some also rely on integer division to do their reasoning about their inputs. And some give you a chance to practice using the <em>conditional statement</em> or “<em>if-else</em>“ statement so that their behavior can depend on conditions of the data input.</p>
<p>You can start work on these exercises in lab. They are all due in a week. We’ll talk more about the conditional statement in the coming lectures.</p>
<h2 id="On-Integer-Division"><a href="#On-Integer-Division" class="headerlink" title="On Integer Division"></a>On Integer Division</h2><p>Several exercises rely on integer division. This can be computed using the quotient operator <code>//</code> and the remainder operator <code>%</code>. Here is an example of their use:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="number">37</span> // <span class="number">10</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">3</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="number">37</span> % <span class="number">10</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">7</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>These two operations are critical for codes and for digital representations of numbers. For example, we can use integer division by 10 to determine a number’s digits because decimal representation uses a base of 10.  We can perform integer division by 2 to determine its <em>bits</em>. This is the <em>binary</em>, or base 2, representation. Mastering these operations now is going to be useful for understanding several computer concepts we introduce later.</p>
<p>Clever people that are new to programming will often invent code like</p>
<center>`dividend - divisor * math.floor(dividend / divisor)`</center>

<p>when they should learn to write</p>
<center>`dividend % divisor`</center>

<p>to compute the remainder due to a division.  The former code seems like the right idea. It says “<em>Perform the division, throwing out the fractional part with <code>floor</code>, that gives you a whole number. When you multiply it by the divisor, we can subtract that from the dividend to see what’s missing. That missing amount is the remainder.</em>“ While this makes sense, there is no reason to rely on floating point operations to perform integer division. Instead, you can directly use the <code>%</code> operation.</p>
<p>You should not need to use floating point in any of the exercises below. Instead, stick to using integers.</p>
<h2 id="The-Conditional-Statement"><a href="#The-Conditional-Statement" class="headerlink" title="The Conditional Statement"></a>The Conditional Statement</h2><p>In lecture we have begun to discuss how Python code can check its data to see if certain conditions are met. For example, we might have an integer variable <code>number</code> and we might check to see if it is a ranking from 1 to 100. Here is a script that does that:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">number = <span class="built_in">int</span>(<span class="built_in">input</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Enter a ranking from 1 to 100: &quot;</span>))</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> (number &lt; <span class="number">1</span>) <span class="keyword">or</span> (number &gt; <span class="number">100</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;The integer &quot;</span>+<span class="built_in">str</span>(number)+<span class="string">&quot; is not a rank.&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;That was a bad entry.&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">else</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Thanks!&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;The number &quot;</span>+<span class="built_in">str</span>(number)+<span class="string">&quot; is indeed a rank.&quot;</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>In the code above, the expression <code>(number &lt; 1)</code> is true whenever the integer they entered is 0 or smaller. And the expression <code>(number &gt; 100)</code> is true if the integer they entered is 101 or greater.  If either condition holds, then the script tells them that the number is not a ranking. Otherwise, it thanks them for their entry of a rank from 1 to 100.</p>
<p>The four lines of code starting with <code>if</code> is a conditional statement. It has the general syntax</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">if condition-to-check :</span><br><span class="line">    lines-to-execute-if-the-condition-holds</span><br><span class="line">else:</span><br><span class="line">    lines-to-execute-otherwise</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The statements in the lines immediately following the <code>if</code> line must be indented, and with four spaces. They are executed whenever the condition checked is true. The statements immediately following the <code>else:</code> line should also each be indented with four spaces. They are executed whenever the condition checked is false.</p>
<p>We will talk more about the <em>if-else</em> statement in lecture, and you will want to use it to finish some of the exercises below.</p>
<h2 id="Submission-and-Autograding"><a href="#Submission-and-Autograding" class="headerlink" title="Submission and Autograding"></a>Submission and Autograding</h2><p>Submit each Python source file containing your script code to the Gradescope site. The problems below are labeled the way they will appear as submission items in Gradescope.  As before, we’ll run a series of tests on a problem submission to see if your code is correct. The autograder will your scripts, trying out different input strings. It checks to see whether the lines output by <code>print</code> match what we expect. Before submitting, you should run your scripts several times, and with different inputs, to make sure that your code is working. Only submit it when you have reasonable confidence that it is correct.</p>
<p>It’s hard to anticipate every possible input, but you should work to anticipate as much as you can.</p>
<p>Some of the problems allow you to assume that a user won’t enter certain kinds of inputs. When we allow you to make assumptions like that, you do not need to check inputs that aren’t assumed to happen.</p>
<h2 id="Scoring"><a href="#Scoring" class="headerlink" title="Scoring"></a>Scoring</h2><p>Each problem is worth 30 points. 10 of the points are awarded based on the number of tests you pass. An additional prize of up to 10 points will be awarded if <em>all</em> the tests pass by the due date.  You’ll earn fewer of these prize points if you have to submit a problem several times to get all the tests to pass. Another 10 points will be given after the deadline as a result of our own assessment of the quality of your code.</p>

<h1 id="Problems"><a href="#Problems" class="headerlink" title="Problems"></a>Problems</h1><h2 id="HW2-P1-menu"><a href="#HW2-P1-menu" class="headerlink" title="[HW2 P1] menu"></a><code>[HW2 P1]</code> menu</h2><p>A friend in the restaurant business has asked you to develop a Python script for typesetting menus for his restaurants.  Below is one he produced by hand on a typewriter for his fancy bistro called “Bobby’s”:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">1234567890123456789012345678901234567890</span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">Bobby&#x27;s Entrees				</span><br><span class="line">---------------</span><br><span class="line">Pasta verde.........................$ 15</span><br><span class="line">Filet mignon w/ lobster and caviar..$107</span><br><span class="line">Hamburger with fries................$  9</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>In the top line, he decided to show that the menus are 40 columns wide. There is a blank line, followed by the restaurant “Entrees” lines, followed by the three entree lines.</p>
<p>Write a script <code>menu.py</code> that produces these menus as output. It should take the restaurant name as input, and then it should take three input strings for the names of three different entrees, along with their prices in whole dollars. Each menu that your program outputs is 7 lines long and includes the top line with the column numbers.</p>
<p>Here is a sample interaction:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Restaurant name? Bobby&#x27;s</span><br><span class="line">First entree? Pasta verde	 </span><br><span class="line">First entree price? 15</span><br><span class="line">Second entree? Filet mignon w/ lobster and caviar</span><br><span class="line">Second entree price? 107</span><br><span class="line">Third entree? Hamburger with fries</span><br><span class="line">Third entree price? 9</span><br><span class="line">    		</span><br><span class="line">1234567890123456789012345678901234567890</span><br><span class="line">    		</span><br><span class="line">Bobby&#x27;s Entrees</span><br><span class="line">---------------</span><br><span class="line">Pasta verde.........................$ 15</span><br><span class="line">Filet mignon w/ lobster and caviar..$107</span><br><span class="line">Hamburger with fries................$  9</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You can assume that entree prices are under a 1000 dollars, and so you should use three columns for formatting their digits. You can also assume that the entree names they enter will fit, along with their price, within the 40 columns. That is, for example, the “Filet mignon…”  entry is one character shorter than the longest string for an item that your script will ever face.</p>
<p>Note that to do this you’ll need to use some combination of the string concatenation, repetition, and length operations, just as in the <code>marquee</code> exercise from the last homework. You’ll also want to convert integers to strings to get the price spacing right.</p>
<h2 id="HW2-P2-tens-digit"><a href="#HW2-P2-tens-digit" class="headerlink" title="[HW2 P2] tens digit"></a><code>[HW2 P2]</code> tens digit</h2><p>In a file called <code>tens_digit.py</code>, write a script that takes an input. It should then report the tens digit of that integer.  You can assume that the integer they enter is 10 or larger. You need not worry about handling smaller integers.</p>
<p>Here is the interaction in the terminal that we expect with your script:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">jimfix@fix-computer homework2 % python3 tens_digit.py</span><br><span class="line">Enter an integer that is larger than 9: 1234</span><br><span class="line">It has a tens digit of 3.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Your code should use the integer division operations, namely the quotient operator <code>//</code> and the remainder operator <code>%</code> to perform this calculation.</p>
<p>Note that there are Python library functions that convert integers to strings of digit characters, and then string operations to extract these digits.  <em>Please don’t use those string operations in your code.</em></p>
<h2 id="HW2-P3-reverse"><a href="#HW2-P3-reverse" class="headerlink" title="[HW2 P3] reverse"></a><code>[HW2 P3]</code> reverse</h2><p>Write a script <code>reverse.py</code> that takes a 3-digit integer as its input.  It should then print the number that has the same three digits but in reverse order. For example, below is the kind of interaction we expect to have with your code. We are running the script three times in a row, each time entering a different integer.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">jimfix@fix-computer homework2 % python3 reverse.py</span><br><span class="line">Enter a 3-digit integer: 345</span><br><span class="line">543</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@fix-computer homework2 % python3 reverse.py</span><br><span class="line">Enter a 3-digit integer: 719</span><br><span class="line">917</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@fix-computer homework2 % python3 reverse.py</span><br><span class="line">Enter a 3-digit integer: 999</span><br><span class="line">999</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You can assume that the script is given an integer that is not divisible by 10.  You can also assume that the function is given an integer that is greater than 100 and less than 1000.</p>
<p>Please <strong>do not</strong> use string operations to determine the digits of an integer.  Just as in the “tens digit” problem, you should use integer division operations <code>//</code> and <code>%</code> to determine the digits of the number.</p>
<h2 id="HW2-P4-n-th-digit"><a href="#HW2-P4-n-th-digit" class="headerlink" title="[HW2 P4] n-th digit"></a><code>[HW2 P4]</code> n-th digit</h2><p>Write a script named <code>nth_digit.py</code> that takes two integer inputs. You can assume that both inputs are non-negative. The second integer is used to describe a digit position of the first. The script should then report that digit in that position within the digits of the first number.</p>
<p>It should behave exactly as follows:</p>

<p>Note that, in the above examples, we are numbering the digits from right to left, starting at 0, and so we are working from the least-significant digit to the most-significant digit.  This means that position 0 corresponds to the ones place, position 1 corresponds to the tens place, position 2 corresponds to the hundreds place, and so on.</p>
<p>Treat positions that are “off to the left” of the digits of the integer as being 0 digits. It’s as if there is an infinite supply of 0s sitting to the left of the actual digits of that number.</p>
<p>You can assume neither number entered is negative.</p>
<p>Just as in the earlier two problems where you are asked to determine the digits of an integer, we ask that you not convert the integer to a string to perform this function’s calculation.  Instead, you should use the integer division operations <code>//</code> and <code>%</code> to determine the number’s digits.</p>
<h2 id="HW2-P5-toonies"><a href="#HW2-P5-toonies" class="headerlink" title="[HW2 P5] toonies"></a><code>[HW2 P5]</code> toonies</h2><p>You decide to visit Canada to do some shopping. You’ve become fond of their one-dollar coin, called a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loonie">“loonie”</a> because its backside depicts a common loon. You are even more fond of their two-dollar coin called a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toonie">“toonie”</a>.  You like the toonie so much, you decide to pay for everything using these two-dollar coins.</p>
<p>Devise a script <code>toonies.py</code> that, when given an item’s cost in Canadian dollars, expresses how many toonies you need to pay for that item. Your script should have this kind of interaction:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">C02MX1KLFH04:homework2 jimfix$ python3 toonies.py </span><br><span class="line">Item cost in Canadian dollars? 21</span><br><span class="line">Pay 11 toonies.</span><br><span class="line">C02MX1KLFH04:homework2 jimfix$ python3 toonies.py </span><br><span class="line">Item cost in Canadian dollars? 20</span><br><span class="line">Pay 10 toonies.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You can assume that the item’s price is a whole dollar amount and at least three dollars. (This means that you’ll never calculate payments of fewer than two toonies.) You should only be using integer calculations for this script. You shouldn’t even need to use the conditional statement.</p>
<p>We are interested here in the evenness and oddness of the payment amount, so you’d look at the amount’s divisibility by two.</p>
<h2 id="HW2-P6-zap-buzz"><a href="#HW2-P6-zap-buzz" class="headerlink" title="[HW2 P6] zap buzz"></a><code>[HW2 P6]</code> zap buzz</h2><p><em>Zap-Buzz</em> is a variant of a common children’s game. The way the game works is that each person takes a turn saying a number, counting upwards from 1. However, if the number is a multiple of 7 they say “zap” instead of the number. If the number has a digit of 3 in it they say “buzz” instead of the number, and if both things are true they say “zap buzz”.</p>
<p>Devise a script <code>zap_buzz.py</code> that plays a turn of the game.  It should take a positive integer input. It should then print that integer if neither of the “zap”&#x2F;“buzz” conditions hold.  If some condition holds, print <code>zap</code>, or print <code>buzz</code>, or print <code>zap buzz</code>, whichever is appropriate. You are allowed to assume the parameter is less than 1000.  As in the earlier exercises, please don’t convert the integer to a string to determine its digits.</p>
<p>Here are several interaction with the code that we might expect:</p>

        <p><strong>Complete and submit Part 1 in lab</strong><br><strong>Submit Part 2 by 1&#x2F;29 at 11:00pm</strong></p>
<p>In this first homework we set-up the software necessary for completing and submitting your work throughout the semester, and we try out some Python programming. By the end of this homework you’ll have run the Python interpreter, written some Python code, tested that code, and submitted it to us so that we can take a look at it. In doing so, you will interact through Gradescope with <code>aga</code>, our automated system that works to check your work and tries its best to give you feedback on it. (<code>aga</code> is named as such because (<code>a</code>)ga (<code>g</code>)rades (<code>a</code>)ssignments!)</p>
<p>You can then start work on the programming exercises to be completed in the next week.</p>
<h1 id="Part-1-Set-Up"><a href="#Part-1-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Set-Up"></a>Part 1: Set-Up</h1><p>Before we dive deeply into the material of the course we first need to make sure your computer has all the software it needs for the course. This first part of the assignment walks you through that process. We have tried to include instructions for all the situations that might arise, but if anything isn’t working, you can work with us to get things set up right.</p>
<p>Here are the steps we take you through:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Join Gradescope</strong> where you’ll submit the work.</li>
<li><strong>Obtain a text editor.</strong> We use this for writing code.</li>
<li><strong>Set up a terminal console</strong> to run Python code.</li>
<li><strong>Obtain Python 3.</strong> This tool knows the Python programming language.</li>
<li><strong>Try the tools</strong> to create two text files.</li>
</ul>
<p>How you take these steps will depend on your computer system. For each we will give you ways of checking whether your set up was successful. When you’ve completed these steps and checks, you’ll submit two files using Gradescope and then move on to Part 2.</p>
<h2 id="Join-the-Gradescope-course"><a href="#Join-the-Gradescope-course" class="headerlink" title="Join the Gradescope course"></a>Join the Gradescope course</h2><p>Your first step is to create a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gradescope.com/">Gradescope</a> account associated with your Reed email. In doing so you can join the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/490535">CSCI 121 Spring 2023 course</a> on Gradescope by using the course code we’ll provide in this lab. You need to join Gradescope in order to submit the work of this assignment and all the future assignments.</p>
<h2 id="Get-a-text-editor"><a href="#Get-a-text-editor" class="headerlink" title="Get a text editor"></a>Get a text editor</h2><p>You will write your code in a text editor, and there are lots of options to pick from. As your next step, install one of the following editors for your system by following its link:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"><strong>Visual Studio Code</strong></a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a></li>
<li>Mac: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"><strong>Visual Studio Code</strong></a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://macromates.com/download">TextMate</a>, vim, emacs, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://aquamacs.org/">AquaMacs</a></li>
<li>Linux: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux"><strong>Visual Studio Code</strong></a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, vim, emacs, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit">Gedit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In lab and lecture we will encourage you to use Visual Studio <strong>Code</strong>, heareafter named <strong>VS Code</strong>, because Microsoft has made it freely available (on Windows <em>and</em> on the Mac). They have designed it to be simple and lightweight (compared to their bloated <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio</a> which we <strong>do not</strong> recommend).  <strong>VS Code</strong> is designed in the spirit of many good and flexible program editors from the free software community.  <strong>Atom</strong> is another good editor that many Reed CS students have adopted, and that CSCI 121 used in recent past, but the group that invented it has announced that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/">it will no longer be supported after December of 2021</a>.  Both editors have a lot of features for writing Python code. They can be configured to do many other programming tasks too, and they both handle code in many other programming languages.</p>
<p>Note that many shared CS computers used for upper-level classes are configured with the <em>console-based</em> editors <code>vim</code> and <code>emacs</code> (as opposed to <em>window-based</em> or <em>GUI</em> editors). The two editors are touted by many programmers and are great to learn, but they’re not as beginner-friendly as the others.  They are great to learn at some point as you learn CS. Maybe wait to try them a few weeks into the course. We ourselves will sometimes use <code>emacs</code> in live demonstrations because we use it in our own work.</p>
<p>You should not use editors that you might use for writing HUM110 papers (like <strong>Word</strong>) for writing program code! Editors for programming create <em>plain text</em> files, which really just contain the “raw” characters of your program’s text (no fonts, no decorations, etc.) so they can be processed and read by a variety of programming tools. If you tried to load, say, a <strong>Word</strong> document into Python, Python would just get confused.</p>
<p>Once you have chosen a text editor, download it. Make sure it opens correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Tabs and spaces</strong></p>
<p>If you aren’t using <strong>VS Code</strong> then you <em>might</em> also need to configure your editor so that it handles Python code well. In particular, you need to make sure it handles the <strong>[tab]</strong> key in a coding-friendly way.  Your text editor needs to be set so that hitting the tab key actually inserts 4 spaces rather than a tab. This is crucial because Python is sensitive to how you indent portions of code, using that indentation to figure out what to do. It can get confused when it sees a mix of tabs and spaces in your code, so it’s best to configure it to treat tab keypresses as spaces.  <strong>VS Code</strong> already does this by default when you are editing a Python code file.</p>
<p>This is often easy to configure, but the process for doing it is a little different for each one, and so you’ll need to figure that out for the one you chose to use. If you have trouble, ask a TA for help. For example, <strong>Atom</strong> can be configured by following the steps in the appendix at the bottom of this page.</p>
<h2 id="Make-coursework-folders"><a href="#Make-coursework-folders" class="headerlink" title="Make coursework folders"></a>Make coursework folders</h2><p>Make a folder called <code>csci121</code> where all your work for this course will be kept, and put it in your computer user’s <code>Documents</code> folder. In the instructions below, we assume you do this. Some people find other locations more convenient, say under <code>Desktop</code> or else directly within the your computer user’s home folder. If you decide to use a different location than <code>Documents/csci121</code> you will have to re-interpret our instructions and example computer interactions accordingly.</p>
<p>Once you have this folder, create a folder inside it called <code>homework1</code> (you’ll do this for each homework or project).  Now download these two files into that folder:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./survey.txt">survey.txt</a></li>
<li><a href="./test.py">test.py</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Start-a-terminal-console"><a href="#Start-a-terminal-console" class="headerlink" title="Start a terminal console"></a>Start a terminal console</h2><p>Most computer systems provide a <em>terminal program</em> so you can work with your computer’s system— run applications and programs, move files and folders around, do low-level tweaks— using a <em>command line console</em>, that is, by having you type commands rather than point and click. This is a typical way many programmers work, especially when they need to run their own code as it develops, and to run scripts, say to automate lots of activities like testing code and working with data files.</p>
<p>We will type console commands into a terminal to run our Python programs.  Mac and Linux already have a terminal program included with the operating system, one that is based on the Unix system. If you have a Mac or Linux, you can just run <strong>Terminal</strong> and that should bring up a window that looks like the console of a 1970s computer.  Windows machines have a tool called <strong>Powershell</strong> that mimics a Unix terminal on their system.  (You can find it by searching for <code>powershell</code> within the Windows Explorer search bar.)</p>
<p>A <strong>terminal console</strong> will only display text, it will display that text in a typewriter font, and it will come up waiting for you to type in a command after printing a prompt.  Here, for example, is what my terminal console looks like when I start<br>it on my Mac:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Last login: Fri Aug 26 06:06:50 on ttys002</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H ~ %</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The first line is a brief system message. The second line is an elaborate prompt up until the <code>% </code> where the system waits for me to enter a command. The full prompt is in the format:</p>
<p>   <code> </code><em>My-User’s-Name</em> <code>@</code> <em>My-Machine’s-Name</em><code> </code><em>Working-Folder</em><code> %</code></p>
<p>My user’s name is <code>jimfix</code>, my computer (for some reason) is called <code>C02F48U1ML7H</code>, and the folder that <strong>Terminal</strong> is working in is my user’s home folder on my computer, abbreviated as <code>~</code>. I can run programs that inspect files in that folder, and I can switch to other folders, and so forth. Here is a longer transcript of a <strong>Terminal</strong> session:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Last login: Fri Aug 26 06:06:50 on ttys002</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H ~ % uname -srm</span><br><span class="line">Darwin 19.6.0 x86_64</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H ~ % pwd</span><br><span class="line">/Users/jimfix</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H ~ % cd ~/git/jimfix.github.io/csci121/lectures/week1/examples</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H examples % ls</span><br><span class="line">circle.py		hello5.py		radius_functions.py</span><br><span class="line">csci11squared.py	hello6.py		radius_import.py</span><br><span class="line">csci121.py		hello_calc.py		shoutout.py</span><br><span class="line">hello.py		integers.py		shoutout4x.py</span><br><span class="line">hello3.py		integers_divide.py	temperature.py</span><br><span class="line">hello4.py		radius.py</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H examples % grep sqrt *.py</span><br><span class="line">radius_functions.py:    from math import pi, sqrt</span><br><span class="line">radius_functions.py:    return sqrt(someArea / pi)</span><br><span class="line">radius_import.py:from math import pi, sqrt</span><br><span class="line">radius_import.py:radius = sqrt(area / pi)</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H examples %</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Each line starting with <code>jimfix</code> ends with a command I typed after <code>%</code>.  Any subsequent lines show the system’s response to that command. For example, the <code>pwd</code> command showed me the full name of the folder I’m working within.</p>
<p>We’ll demonstrate a few more of these commands in later steps.</p>
<p><strong>Other options for running a terminal</strong></p>
<p>It turns out that the <strong>VS Code</strong> editor has the ability to run a terminal console. In <strong>VS Code</strong> select the menu item <em>Terminal &gt; New Terminal</em>.  This will open up a terminal console just at the bottom of the editor.  On a Mac system, this will run the <code>zsh</code> tool that is also run inside Mac’s <strong>Terminal</strong> program. On a Windows system, this will run <code>powershell</code>.</p>
<p>For Windows machines, we offer two more options in the appendices on <a href="#appendices/appendix:gettingawindowsterminalusinggittools">Git tools</a> and <a href="#appendices/appendix:gettingawindowsterminalusingwsl">WSL</a> at the bottom of this document. Since Mac and Linux are actually flavors of the Unix operating system, the commands we type are actually part of their system. In Windows, <code>powershell</code> is emulating those commands to run things in Windows. Because of the fact that Windows is a different system, historically Windows users have had to have complicated solutions to get a terminal console that offers Unix-like commands. The appendices give you two other, more expert ways of emulating a Unix console environment on Windows.</p>
<h2 id="Install-Python"><a href="#Install-Python" class="headerlink" title="Install Python"></a>Install Python</h2><p>The next piece of software you’ll want to put on your computer is Python.  If you have a Mac, Python 2 comes pre-installed, but this is not the version we will be using.  You should instead download the latest version of Python 3 (currently 3.10.6) <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>.  Make sure to pick the correct download for your operating system.  Follow the instructions on that site to download and install Python 3.</p>
<p>If you have a Windows machine you can install Python 3 the same way. Go to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">the Python website</a> and get the Windows version. Alternatively, you could open the Microsoft Store on your computer and search for Python. Make sure to select the latest version, which currently is Python 3.10.</p>
<p>(If you use Linux or installed the Ubuntu WSL (see Appendix at the end of this page), these already have Python 3 installed. You don’t need to do anything!)</p>
<h2 id="Play-with-Python"><a href="#Play-with-Python" class="headerlink" title="Play with Python"></a>Play with Python</h2><p>Bring up a terminal. Once you get a command prompt, you can enter the Python 3 command. For nearly all of you, this should be <code>python3</code>.  For some Windows users this may instead be <code>py</code> or <code>python</code>. Here is a Mac terminal session that starts Python 3:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H ~ % python3</span><br><span class="line">Python 3.9.10 (main, Jan 15 2022, 11:48:15) </span><br><span class="line">[Clang 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.29)] on darwin</span><br><span class="line">Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The key thing that you should see is the <strong>Python prompt</strong> <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>.  (Not to be confused with the <strong>command prompt</strong>!) Here you can type individual lines of Python code and watch them be evaluated immediately.  If you type <code>4+5</code> and then press the <code>[return]</code> key, it should print <code>9</code> on the next line and give you a new <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt.  Try each of the Python code suggested below and make sure that you get the same responses.  The lines starting with <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> contain the code you should type at the prompt.  The other lines should appear automatically as responses.</p>

<p>The last line with <code>quit()</code> tells Python to exit and should return you back to the terminal, at which point you get back the command prompt. As before, at the command prompt, you can enter console commands, not Python expressions. </p>
<h2 id="Run-a-Python-program"><a href="#Run-a-Python-program" class="headerlink" title="Run a Python program"></a>Run a Python program</h2><p>We now want to run the <code>test.py</code> file, which contains a Python program.  To do this, we need to learn some more Unix commands.  For now, we will learn <code>cd</code> (change directory, i.e. folder) and <code>ls</code> (list a folder’s contents).</p>
<p>When you’re working in the terminal, your computer keeps track of the folder you are currently working in. Each session starts by default in your computer user’s home folder. If you ever want to return directly to that home folder, you can type the <code>cd</code> command.  You can display the contents of the folder you’re in (both sub-folders and files) by typing the <code>ls</code> command. If the folder you’re in contains the sub-folder named <code>inner</code>, you get to it by typing <code>cd inner</code>.  If you want to move up one level into the parent folder containing the current folder, you do it with the <code>cd ..</code> command. For example, on my Mac, I might use the following commands below to navigate to the folder for this assignment.</p>

<p>In the terminal interaction lines above, there are prompts for a command line (e.g. <code>jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H homework1 %</code>) and I have typed the commands that follow the percent sign. In the first line, I went to my home folder, and then used three commands to go into <code>~/Documents/csci121/homework1</code> . Finally, I entered <code>pwd</code> just to verify where I was working and then <code>ls</code> to inspect the contents of that folder.</p>
<p>Play around with the commands to get used to this kind of navigation. Should you get lost during this play, you can always type the command <code>pwd</code> (print the “working”, or current, directory) to see where you are.</p>
<p>Once you are in your <code>homework1</code> folder the command <code>ls</code> should list the two files we have put there, <code>test.py</code> and <code>survey.txt</code>.  Now, enter the Python command, just like you did earlier, but include the file name <code>test.py</code> on that same line, like so.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">python3 test.py</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>(Recall that if this Python command doesn’t work, you can try typing <code>py</code>, or perhaps <code>python3.10</code> or <code>python3.9</code> in case for some reason the system you’re using isn’t strictly what we’d expect from the instructions we gave above. On Windows, it might just be <code>python</code>.)</p>
<p>Entering this full command should run that program’s code, and it should print a number in the terminal.  Write this number down. You’ll need it in a minute.</p>
<h2 id="Problems-for-Part-1"><a href="#Problems-for-Part-1" class="headerlink" title="Problems for Part 1"></a>Problems for Part 1</h2><p>• <strong>[HW1 P1] survey</strong></p>
<p>Let’s begin working on the first two problems for this assignment. We’ll start by editing a simple text file in your text editor.</p>
<p>Use your chosen text editor to open the <code>survey.txt</code> file.  In it, you’ll see a bunch of survey questions meant to help us get to know you.  Type your answers below the questions, then save the modified file.</p>
<p>There. You’ve completed the first problem. If you would like, you can learn a little more about the Terminal console, and you can use it to verify the work. Go back to the Terminal and try out some of the commands below, assuming that its still working in the <code>homework1</code> folder:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H homework1 % ls -ltr</span><br><span class="line">total 16</span><br><span class="line">-rw-r--r--  1 jimfix  staff  108 Aug 27 09:12 test.py</span><br><span class="line">-rw-r--r--  1 jimfix  staff  735 Aug 27 09:34 survey.txt</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H homework1 % cat survey.txt</span><br><span class="line">1.

<p>The first command <code>ls -ltr</code> gives a more elaborate report of the contents of the <code>homework1</code> folder. It lists a (<code>l</code>)ong version of its files, according to their (<code>t</code>)imestamp, and in (<code>r</code>)everse order so that the most recently edited file appears at the bottom.  You’ll see that the number of characters in those text files are reported (the <code>108</code> and the <code>735</code> values) and the time that each was created or last edited.</p>
<p>The other two commands <code>cat</code> and <code>more</code> are two different ways of using the terminal to inspect the contents of a file. They both show the series of lines of <code>survey.txt</code>, though the <code>more</code> command does this interactively. It waits for you to hit <code>[space]</code> if the file contents go beyond a single screen’s worth of information, and to hit <code>q</code> or <code>[return]</code> (or probably most keys) when you are done looking at the file. The <code>cat</code> command just blasts all the contents out to the console without pause, even if it’s a large amount of text.</p>
<p>In both cases, you should expect to see the contents of the survey with your changes. </p>
<hr>
<p>• <strong>[HW1 P2] code</strong></p>
<p>Now let’s write some Python code.</p>
<p>Use the editor to create a new file where we will write the code of a Python program.  In <strong>VS Code</strong>, for example, you would want to select the menu item <em>File &gt; New Text File</em>. Having done that, the editor opens a new sub-window that has some helpful text written inside it. You should immediately click on the highlighted words <code>Select a language</code> on line 1 of that helpful text. Scroll through the options to find and select the Python language.</p>
<p>Now go ahead and type the following Python code into the file, replacing any initial text that the editor provided. The file should just be this code:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">first</span>(<span class="params">a, b</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    c = <span class="number">3</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> a &gt; b:</span><br><span class="line">        c = <span class="number">4</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> a**c - b</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>You will want to literally type in the code, rather than cut and paste.  Some characters that appear in documents look the same but are not the same as the keys you would press yourself (double quotes and hyphens are notorious examples of this trickiness). Furthermore, you should make sure that you indent each of the lines after the first using spaces– 4 spaces for lines 2, 3, and 5; 8 spaces for line 4.  (If your editor is configured correctly to treat tabs as spaces, you can tab once for lines 2, 3, and 5; hit tab twice for line 4.)</p>
<p>Save the file with the above code as <code>code.py</code>.  Most text editors will now know that your file is a file of Python code and will color it accordingly, with specific colors assigned to functions, variables, etc.</p>
<p>You can verify that it was saved with <code>ls</code>, <code>cat</code>, or <code>more</code> in terminal if you like. You could also use your computer’s file browser to see if a new file named <code>code.py</code> has been created.</p>
<p><em>Trying out your Python code</em></p>
<p>Now I know that you probably followed our instructions well and copied the code verbatim.  Even so, you should want to see if the code works before you hand it in.  We will explain this more carefully in future lectures and labs, but there is no harm in just trying things out now.  In the terminal type the following command:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">python3 -i code.py</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>This is the same <code>python3</code> command you entered earlier along with some extra information.  This runs the program you’ve written in a different way. It reads in the code in <code>code.py</code> code first, and then allows you to <em>interact</em> with Python, prompting you for more Python code. For example, here is a session that I ran with my code in the terminal:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H homework1 % python3 -i code.py</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; first(100,1)</span><br><span class="line">99999999</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; quit()</span><br><span class="line">jimfix@C02F48U1ML7H homework1 %</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Here, I enter the Python command, and then I enter a Python expression after the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt.  Python responds on the next line with a number computed from the expression <code>first(100,1)</code> If instead you see errors rather than an integer, talk with a TA.  To stop playing with the code within Python, Enter <code>quit()</code> at a <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt to leave the Python system and go back to entering terminal commands.</p>
<p>Understand that this is hardly testing the code, and rather just an easy sanity check compared to what we expect for later homework and projects.</p>
<h2 id="Submit-your-work-for-Part-1"><a href="#Submit-your-work-for-Part-1" class="headerlink" title="Submit your work for Part 1"></a>Submit your work for Part 1</h2><p>We’re ready for the final step, submitting the completed work.  To do this, go to Gradescope (and log in) and navigate to the site’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/490535">CSCI 121 Spring 2023 course</a> page. You should see several assignments there, including one called <strong>[HW1 P1] survey</strong> and another called <strong>[HW1 P2] code</strong>.  When you click on each, you’ll get a <em>Submit Programming Assignment</em> pop-up that will ask you to upload the file you need to submit for that problem. For “code”, upload the file <code>code.py</code>, but only once you’ve run it yourself.  For “survey” upload the file <code>survey.txt</code>, but only once you’ve edited and saved it with your survey responses. For each, the system should tell you that the problem was successfully submitted.</p>
<p>The system then inspects the document you submitted and does work to give you more detailed feedback on its contents. In the case of the first problem, your submitted survey will get scanned by a script. In the case of the second problem, the code you submit will be run by a test script. For each, some results should appear shortly and a score out of 20 will get reported. Sometimes the system is slow but the score should eventually appear. Let us know if for some reason it does not.</p>
<p>If you see an autograder score of 20 for each, you will have completed Part 1 of this assignment. Congrats! You’re ready to do more interesting things in Part 2.</p>
<h1 id="Part-2-Some-Scripting"><a href="#Part-2-Some-Scripting" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Some Scripting"></a>Part 2: Some Scripting</h1><p>In the lectures we covered some key elements of the Python language. We showed examples of some simple Python <em>interactive scripts</em> that can be run in the terminal.  Python allows your program to read what’s entered into the terminal (using <code>input</code>) and to report computed values (using <code>print</code>).  In this Part 2 we write a couple scripts, test them to see that they work, and then submit them to Gradescope.</p>
<p>Below, for example, is a short three-line script that performs temperature unit conversion, getting a temperature in degrees celsius, then reporting the equivalent in degrees fahrenheit:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">c = <span class="built_in">float</span>(<span class="built_in">input</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Temperature in degrees celsius? &quot;</span>))</span><br><span class="line">f = (c * <span class="number">9.0</span> / <span class="number">5.0</span>) + <span class="number">32.0</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(f)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Running the code, we see that <code>input</code> produces a prompt, then waits for the user to enter a value. Python reads their entry as a string of characters, and so we use <code>float</code> to convert those characters to a floating-point numeric value.  The second line, a variable assignment to <code>f</code> using the value <code>c</code>, computes the floating point value according to that calculation. The value of variable <code>f</code> gets printed because of the last line of the script.</p>
<p>Here’s what happens in Terminal when we run that code using the <code>python3</code> command and, say, enter <code>100.0</code>:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">jimfix@C02MX1KLFH04:homework1 jimfix$ python3 temperature.py</span><br><span class="line">Temperature in degrees celsius? 100.0</span><br><span class="line">212.0</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>It’s possible to make the output of <code>print</code> more readable by including other text in that line of output. To do this, we can explictly convert the temperature value to a string of characters using the <code>str</code> conversion function and then append strings around that formatted information. We append strings using the <code>+</code> operator. For example, if we change the last line of the code above to</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">c = <span class="built_in">float</span>(<span class="built_in">input</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Temperature in degrees celsius? &quot;</span>))</span><br><span class="line">f = (c * <span class="number">9.0</span> / <span class="number">5.0</span>) + <span class="number">32.0</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;That is &quot;</span> + <span class="built_in">str</span>(f) + <span class="string">&quot; in degrees fahrenheit.&quot;</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>it leads to this interaction</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">jimfix@C02MX1KLFH04:homework1 jimfix$ python3 temperature.py</span><br><span class="line">Temperature in degrees celsius? 100.0</span><br><span class="line">That is 212.0 in degrees fahrenheit.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Note the spaces that we used to separate the number from the other text of the sentence.</p>
<p>Each of the exercises below asks you to write a Python script similar to the one above. Each program you write takes an input, or a series of inputs.  It then performs calculations on that input data and produces a formatted output of those calculations’ results. We first ask you to work with strings alone. You then work with integer and floating point values. For these you’ll want to convert input strings into numbers using the <code>int</code> and <code>float</code> functions.</p>
<h2 id="Submission-and-Autograding"><a href="#Submission-and-Autograding" class="headerlink" title="Submission and Autograding"></a>Submission and Autograding</h2><p>You should run your scripts several times, and with different inputs, to make sure that your code is working. Once you have reasonable confidence that it is working, submit it at the appropriate assignment link on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/490535">the Gradescope site for this course</a>.</p>
<p>When you upload the file for that problem on Gradescope we’ll immediately run a series of tests on that code to see if it is correct. Within a minute or so, you’ll get feedback from our <code>aga</code> Gradescope autograder” as a series of messages. If all these tests pass, then these messages will be green. Any failed tests will give a red message, and usually with some extra information underneath that can help you figure out what we found wrong with the code.</p>
<p>Our ability to give feedback in this way is limited, so you should seek help from your instructor or a tutor to help you explain what went wrong, and to help you think about fixing the problem. On some rare occasions some of you may face something that’s wrong with our set-up so it’s helpful to reach out to us if you are confused by the autograder’s report. There will be those moments when there’s something we didn’t anticipate in your submission, hopefully rarely.</p>
<p>Do not use Gradescope to test your code. Instead run the code yourself using Python’s interpreter and only submit once you’re convinced that the code is correct. If you fail some of our tests that should give you some pause. Take a moment to carefully look through your code and fix it, and then run some of your own tests before submitting it again. Don’t just make a quick change, cross your fingers, and submit it again.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>
<p>Each problem is worth 30 points. 20 of those points are assigned by the aga auto-grader, and the remaining 10 will be assigned later by one of us.</p>
<p>The auto-graded score is determined by some thoughtful test inputs that we’ve devised to check different scenarios. Our use of automated testing is meant to mimic real-world software coding, where a programmer’s code has to work in practice, sometimes facing unanticipated but perfectly reasonable scenarios.</p>
<p>The hand-graded score reflects our sense of your coding. Was it clear and succinct? Or did it do something unusual just to get the tests to pass? When we get to more complicated coding, these points will help us give feedback on code “style.” Making complicated code human-readable and human-understandable is often as important as whether the code works, especially for larger coding projects.</p>
<p>We split the auto-graded score into two components. We give points for passing some of the tests. This helps us to at least see the progress you’ve made in tackling the problem. This will be especially valuable for later assignments when you’ve figured out most of the problem but maybe haven’t considered some tricky “edge cases” yet.</p>
<p>The auto-grader also awards a “prize” component with its scoring. To get this prize, your code has to pass all the tests by the assignment deadline, and without too many attempts. If you submit answers for a single problem several times, with only incremental fixes, you get fewer prize points than if you test your code on your own, anticipate all the different cases, and get it working, say, on your first or second submission.</p>
<p>Both the test score and the hand-graded score allow us to reward you for figuring out most, if not all, of the problem’s puzzle. And the hand-grading allows us to give feedback on the quality of your code. The prize score is an additional incentive that encourages you to work on assignments in a timely fashion and to carefully test your code rather than just blindly submit it with little thought.</p>
<p>In summary here is how we score your work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>test score:</strong> <em>(automated)</em> partial or full credit for passing tests</li>
<li><strong>style score:</strong> <em>(by hand)</em> partial or full credit for clear, succinct, readable code; and for good attempts that maybe miss some cases</li>
<li><strong>prize score:</strong> <em>(automated)</em> credit for passing all tests on time, discounted if you submit too often because you didn’t anticipate some test cases</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Problems-for-Part-2"><a href="#Problems-for-Part-2" class="headerlink" title="Problems for Part 2"></a>Problems for Part 2</h2><p>• <strong>[HW1 P3] hal</strong></p>
<p>In the science fiction movie <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, the artificial intelligence of the <code>HAL 9000</code> computer, when commanded to do something, tells the main astronaut character:</p>

<p>Write a Python script <code>hal.py</code> that replicates this interaction.  It should prompt for a name to be entered, and then take a string as input.  It should then prompt for an action it should take, and then take a second string as input.</p>

I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t do that.</span><br><span class="line">(The action &quot;Open the pod bay doors.&quot; was not performed.)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>In that example, the first two lines are each a combination of a printed prompt (each ending with a space character) followed by the characters entered by the person running the program. Here, they entered <code>Dave</code> and hit the <code>[return]</code> key and then <code>Open the pod bay doors.</code> followed by the <code>[return]</code> key.</p>
<p>After these two entries, a blank line and then the next two lines are printed by the script.</p>
<p>Here is another example of an expected interaction with your program when run:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">What is your name? stanley kubrick</span><br><span class="line">Ok. Now enter an action: cut!!!</span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">I&#x27;m sorry, stanley kubrick. I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t do that.</span><br><span class="line">(The action &quot;cut!!!&quot; was not performed.)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Your program’s interactions must <em>exactly</em> mimic the examples above.  There should be a space between each prompt and the program user’s input. There should be one space before the name and a period immediately following it.  There should be a double quote character just before and just after the action. Note that, even though the document you are reading (this one here) might make it appear so, there should be no spaces at the start of each line.  The lines are each left justified.</p>
<p>Note that you can output a blank line with the python statement</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">print()</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>that is, by giving <code>print</code> no argument within the parentheses.</p>
<p>Do your best to test your code and check the output, comparing it with our expected output. Be wary of your spacing before you submit.  The interaction’s transcript is in a fixed-width (i.e. monospaced or “typewriter”) font, so each character, including spaces, appears in its own column. This means that the output characters can be seen to line up within a grid as depicted below:</p>
<p><img src="/121-S23/2023/01/11/hw1/hal-grid.gif" alt="*Figure.* Gridding of terminal output."></p>
<p>Now, with all that being said, get that AI working!  (Or, I suppose, get it <em>not working</em>— HAL is <em>stubborn</em> and unwilling to do anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
<p>A big issue here is that there are two ways to describe a string of characters in Python. For example printing a <code>Hello.</code> line can be expressed in a program as</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">print(&quot;Hello.&quot;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>using double quotes around the string of characters and also instead using single quotes with</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">print(&#x27;Hello.&#x27;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>But this means that the single quote character <code>&#39;</code> and the double quote character <code>&quot;</code> have special meaning in this code. So, for example, you have to do extra work if you literally want a quote within a string.  For example, <code>Don&#39;t.</code> could be expressed in two ways:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">print(&quot;Don&#x27;t.&quot;)</span><br><span class="line">print(&#x27;Don\&#x27;t.&#x27;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The second form uses the “escape” backslash character <code>\ </code> to alert Python that a special character is coming next. So we read <code>\&#39;</code> as “escape to quote” There is also <code>\\ </code> for “escape to backslash”, <code>\t</code> for “escape to tab”, and <code>\n</code> for embedding an escaped request to start a new line within the middle string.</p>

<p>• <strong>[HW1 P4] temperature</strong></p>
<p>I’ve written a simple interactive script, downloadable <a href="./temperature.py"><strong>as this linked file</strong></a> called <code>temperature.py</code> that requests an input, a numeric value that will be treated as a temperature in degrees celsius. The program, after that amount is entered, reports the equivalent temperature in degrees fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Here is the Python code for that program:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">c = <span class="built_in">float</span>(<span class="built_in">input</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Temperature in degrees celsius? &quot;</span>))</span><br><span class="line">f = (c * <span class="number">9.0</span> / <span class="number">5.0</span>) + <span class="number">32.0</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;That is &quot;</span>+<span class="built_in">str</span>(f)+<span class="string">&quot; in degrees fahrenheit.&quot;</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>And here is an example of its execution in terminal:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">C02MX1KLFH04:homework1 jimfix$ python3 temperature.py </span><br><span class="line">Temperature in degrees celsius? 40.5</span><br><span class="line">That is 104.9 in degrees fahrenheit.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The program takes a string as input and, assuming that its user types in a valid number, converts that string to a floating point value (with the <code>float(•)</code> conversion we described in lecture). It uses the variable <code>c</code> to store that value. It then assigns the variable <code>f</code> to the appropriate number of degrees, according to the celsius-to-fahrenheit formula. It then outputs that amount, but has to do so by converting the floating point value held in <code>f</code> to a string (with the <code>str(•)</code> conversion we also described in lecture).</p>
<p>Modify the code so that it instead asks for a temperature in degrees fahrenheit and reports the equivalent in degrees celsius.  Your program should lead to interactions like this one:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">C02MX1KLFH04:homework1 jimfix$ python3 temperature.py </span><br><span class="line">Temperature in degrees fahrenheit? 104.9</span><br><span class="line">That is 40.5 in degrees celsius.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Just like in the first exercise, you should get the spacing exactly right before you submit your code.</p>

<p>• <strong>[HW1 P5] distance</strong></p>
<p>We’re writing a new app that allows people in Portland to find where they are relative to Reed’s campus, one that presents a map to the app’s user.  The center of Eliot Circle is the origin of the map.  When a person is walking around, the app gives a two-dimensional coordinate of their location, $(x,y)$, giving them a position within a grid laid over the map.  The $x$ coordinate indicates how many miles east of Eliot Circle they are. The $y$ cordinate indicates how many miles north of Eliot Circle they are.</p>
<p>At any moment, the app tells them their distance from Eliot Circle, and that is computed (using the Pythagorean Theorem) to be</p>
<p>$$\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$</p>
<p>that is, the square root of the sum of the square of the distance east with the square of the distance north.</p>
<p>We want to enhance the app so that it allows a student to figure out their distance from a classroom. If they are located at $(x_1,y_1)$ and the classroom is located at $(x_2,y_2)$, then their distance from that classroom is</p>
<p>$$\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$</p>
<p>Write a Python script <code>distance.py</code> that allows you to experiment with this distance calculation. It should take the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of one location, and then the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of a second location. It should then report the distance using the above calculation.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Location x-coordinate? 3.2</span><br><span class="line">Location y-coordinate? 1.5</span><br><span class="line">Classroom x-coordinate? 6.2</span><br><span class="line">Classroom y-coordinate? -2.5</span><br><span class="line">Distance:</span><br><span class="line">5.0</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Note that you can compute the square root by using the exponentiation operator <code>**</code> and with an exponent of <code>0.5</code>. It’s also possible to <code>import</code> Python’s <code>math</code> package which defines a function <code>sqrt</code>.  Either is fine, one requires that you practice using <code>import</code>.  To import, put this line at the very top of the code, before the script that does the work:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">from</span> math <span class="keyword">import</span> sqrt</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>and then any code below that line will know about the function <code>sqrt</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p>• <strong>[HW1 P6] marquee</strong></p>
<p>Write a Python program <code>marquee.py</code> that attempts to mimic movie theater marquee signs, putting a word “<em>in lights</em>“.  To get an idea of what we want, below is an execution of the program:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Word? hello</span><br><span class="line">    	</span><br><span class="line">*********</span><br><span class="line">* hello *</span><br><span class="line">*********</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The first line is the input prompt, along with an entry of the word <code>hello</code>.  The second output line is just a blank line. The next three lines show the word decorated with surrounding asterisks.</p>
<p>Here is a second interaction:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Word? The Big Lebowski</span><br><span class="line">   	</span><br><span class="line">********************</span><br><span class="line">* The Big Lebowski *</span><br><span class="line">********************</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>To do this you need to use some string operations. We’ve been using string concatenation, designated with the <code>+</code> plus sign above.  Recall also that the <code>*</code> asterisk can be used for string repetition. For example, the expression <code>&#39;hi&#39;*5</code> means <code>&#39;hihihihihi&#39;</code>.  Here are some other examples of string repetition in Python:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="string">&#x27;hi&#x27;</span>*<span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">&#x27;hihi&#x27;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="string">&#x27;hi&#x27;</span>*<span class="number">0</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">&#x27;&#x27;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="string">&#x27;hello &#x27;</span> + (<span class="string">&#x27;hey &#x27;</span> * <span class="number">3</span>) + <span class="string">&#x27;bye&#x27;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">&#x27;hello hey hey hey bye&#x27;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The other string operation you need is a function that computes the length of a string, <code>len</code>. It gives the number of characters in the string’s sequence.  Here are some example uses of <code>len</code>:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; len(&#x27;hello&#x27;)</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; len(&#x27;Hello, I must be going.&#x27;)</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Note that it counts each space, each letter, and each punctuation mark laid out between the quotes.  </p>
<p>String concatenation, repetition, and length should be enough tools needed to make <code>marquee.py</code>.</p>
<h1 id="Appendices"><a href="#Appendices" class="headerlink" title="Appendices"></a>Appendices</h1><h2 id="Appendix-configuring-Atom-tabbing"><a href="#Appendix-configuring-Atom-tabbing" class="headerlink" title="Appendix: configuring Atom tabbing"></a>Appendix: configuring Atom tabbing</h2><p>You can configure <strong>Atom</strong> to use spaces by going to the menu bar at the top of the screen and finding the menu selection <em>Atom &gt; Preferences…</em>. This will bring up a <em>Settings</em> pane with an option list <em>Core</em>, <em>Editor</em>, etc. Select <em>Editor</em> and scroll through the various configurable options scanning for a check-box named <em>Soft Tabs</em>. Select this option with a check mark so that “soft tabs” are enabled. “Soft” means that when you hit the <code>[tab]</code> key a number of spaces will be entered instead. (“Hard” would mean that an actual tab is inserted.)</p>
<p>You should also change the <em>Tab Length</em> setting (just a little below the soft tabs setting). Set its field to <code>4</code>. <strong>Atom</strong> can be clever in reading source code that was written using different settings. It is willing to work with both hard tabs and soft tabs, mimicking the file it is reading. If you set the option <em>Tab Type</em> to <code>soft</code>, then it will just always insert spaces when you hit <code>[tab]</code> regardless of the other sections of the code. This is probably the option you should prefer.</p>
<h2 id="Appendix-getting-a-Windows-terminal-using-Git-tools"><a href="#Appendix-getting-a-Windows-terminal-using-Git-tools" class="headerlink" title="Appendix: getting a Windows terminal using Git tools"></a>Appendix: getting a Windows terminal using Git tools</h2><p>A different option for getting a terminal on Windows that has worked for CSCI 121 students in the past is to download and install a program provided by the GitHub service, as part of its Windows tools, called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gitforwindows.org/">GitBash</a>.  If you can get this installed, it works the same as the terminal programs on the Mac and on Linux.</p>
<h2 id="Appendix-getting-a-Windows-terminal-using-WSL"><a href="#Appendix-getting-a-Windows-terminal-using-WSL" class="headerlink" title="Appendix: getting a Windows terminal using WSL"></a>Appendix: getting a Windows terminal using WSL</h2><p>A fairly advanced option for getting a terminal on Windows is one used by students taking our CSCI 221 course. You can install a <strong>Windows System for Linux</strong> or <strong>WSL2</strong> on Windows. (The current version is 2.) A WSL is a bit more feature-rich than Powershell and GitBash (described just above). It essentially has you put a mini Unix computer system (sometimes called a “virtual machine”) onto your computer. This will be especially useful after this course, as you’ll probably see need to use other Unix tools beyond those for Python programming, and the skills you’ve learned in this class will probably motivate you to do so.</p>
<p>To install a WSL open up the <strong>Microsoft Store</strong> and search for <strong>Linux</strong>. This will bring up several Linux distributions as applications that you can download. Select the <strong>Ubuntu</strong> one and install it. Alternatively, you can probably just search directly for “Ubuntu” in the store.</p>
<p>Once you’ve downloaded that software application, go ahead and run it.  Running the Ubuntu WSL brings up a Unix console window, one that will (because it is your first time running it) ask you to name your WSL user and provide its password. I recommend using your Reed login name and password here, but you can choose whatever you like. This username&#x2F;password combo will be what you type in every time you run this Ubuntu WSL application.</p>
<p>Because this acts like a computer within your computer, it acts like it has its own structure of files and folders. But you can access your normal Windows system files and folders (the stuff that’s normally on your <code>C:</code> drive) using a special “folder path” here within WSL.  For example if you type the command</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">cd /mnt/c/Users/WINDOWS-NAME/csci121</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>where <code>WINDOWS-NAME</code> is your Windows user name, this will take you into the folder we had you make with the “<strong>Make coursework folders</strong>“ step up above. If you don’t know your Windows user name, typing the command</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">ls /mnt/c/Users</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>should give you a list of possible user names on the system, and it should hopefully be obvious which one is yours.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to create a shortcut to your coursework folder within this WSL subsystem. If you enter the commands</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">cd ~</span><br><span class="line">ln -s /mnt/c/Users/WINDOWS-NAME/csci121 csci121</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>then this will create a “symbolic link” called <code>csci121</code> in your WSL user’s home, and that is a system item that refers to the actual <code>csci121</code> folder in your Window’s user’s home.</p>
<p>This all sounds complicated, and it’s not necessary for this course.  Nevertheless, some of you might enjoy giving it a try.</p>
